Ron,

This probably belongs in the "Duh" category, but it may save someone else some 
trouble.  The software compiled fine for me and the yaDSKY and yaAGC programs 
seemed to start OK from the SimValidation script, but they never seemed to do 
anything.

 I am running Suse Linux 9.1 on a machine that does not have an Ethernet card 
or other NIC.  It has only a dialup connection.  The default hostname Suse 
assigns is "linux", but with my setup it did not add an entry for it to 
the /etc/hosts file.   Thus, the gethostbyname function returns null, causing 
the EstablishSocket() function to fail on error 0x101 agc_utilities.c.  

It looks like the yaAGC module uses the hostname  returned by gethostname, but 
yaDSKY uses "localhost".  As a workaround, I just added my hostname "linux" 
to the localhost line in /etc/hosts.  SimValidation now works.

Thanks for all your hard work on this project.  It is really impressive!
