## Purpose:      Part of the source code for Retread 44 (revision 0). It was
##               the very first program for the Block II AGC, created as an
##               extensive rewrite of the Block I program Sunrise.
##               This file is intended to be a faithful transcription, except
##               that the code format has been changed to conform to the
##               requirements of the yaYUL assembler rather than the
##               original YUL assembler.
## Reference:    p. 14
## Assembler:    yaYUL
