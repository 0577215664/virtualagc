# MAIN.agc is a little different from the other Aurora12 files
# provided, in that it doesn't represent anything that appears
# directly in the original source.  What we have done for
# organizational purposes is to split the huge monolithic source
# code into smaller, more manageable chunks--i.e., into individual
# source files.  Those files are rejoined within this file as
# "includes".  It just makes it a little easier to work with.  The
# code chunks correspond to natural divisions into sub-programs.
# The divisions are by the assembly listing itself.
