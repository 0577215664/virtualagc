  <h2>Why Does it Say "ibiblio" All Over these Pages, and Yet the
  Site URL is "github" ... Maybe?</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>At the moment, there are two Virtual AGC websites.&nbsp;
    Actually, it's even more confusing, as you may find the site
    referenced as any of the following:<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href=
      "https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo">https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo</a></li>
      <li><a href=
      "https://virtualagc.github.io/virtualagc/index.html">https://virtualagc.github.io/virtualagc/index.html</a></li>
      <li>https://rburkey2005.github.io/virtualagc ... which is a
      now-broken link to the site mentioned just above.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <p>What a mess!&nbsp; The explanation is that the site is being
    developed in conjunction with our github repository, using the
    github website as a "staging area" for changes, and then the
    content is pushed to our ibiblio website afterward. We're
    trying an experiment in managing the site collaboratively
    rather than having me (Ron Burkey) continue to manage it as an
    individual, as well as tying the website more-closely to our
    github code repository.&nbsp; It may eventually be an actual
    migration to github, though that's undecided yet.&nbsp; In the
    interim, you can view either site more-or-less interchangeably.
    The github site is likely to be a little more up-to-date, but
    may have errors in it that need to be fixed before pushing the
    content to ibiblio.&nbsp; You choose which you'd prefer.&nbsp;
    Using the Google search bar on the pages will always return
    results about ibiblio and not github.<br></p>
    <p>But there's no intention of abandoning ibiblio, regardless
    of the eventual URL of the website.&nbsp; Only the web pages
    might move over to github.&nbsp; The vast document library,
    page images of AGC assembly listings, and supplemental
    materials that people have sent me over the years will continue
    to be hosted at ibiblio.&nbsp; At this writing, there's about
    5.5GB of material that we will continue to host at ibiblio, and
    that's expected (hoped?) to continue to increase considerably
    in the future.<br></p>

  <h2>Is there a Wiki for this project?<br></h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    If you have AGC/AGS information you'd like to contribute, you
    could do so by contacting me directly.&nbsp; However a more
    straightforward approach may be to <a href=
    "https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc/wiki">contribute
    your knowledge to the wiki</a>.&nbsp; Examples of things that
    are useful are theoretical discussions, historical information
    or anecdotes, tutorials on how to perform certain tasks with
    the AGC or AGS, etc.&nbsp; You may be required to register ...
    but I'm not sure exactly how it works.&nbsp; Yes, this is a
    hassle, but it's a one-time thing and it helps to keep the wiki
    reliable.<br>
  </div>
  <h2>Is there a mailing list for this project?</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    There is!&nbsp; If you'd like to subscribe, changes the
    preferences of your existing subscription, or unsubscribe, go
    to<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href=

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">
      <br>
      <b>Important note:</b>&nbsp; For whatever reason, the mailing
      list subscription form has been rejecting new subscribers
      with a message like "invalid capcha".&nbsp; I have so far
      been unable to resolve this with ibiblio.&nbsp; If this
      happens to you, email me directly (at the address at the
      bottom of this page), and I will manually subscribe you to
      the list.<br>
      <br>
      I expect this to be a <span style=
      "font-style: italic;">very</span> low-traffic mailing list,
      devoted to very technical questions, if my own inbox is any
      indication.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; However, as with any mailing
      list, you're taking your chances.&nbsp; It's a members-only
      mailing list, so hopefully you'll be spammed by it only if
      spammers spoof the email address of existing members.&nbsp;
      Also, there are various options you can set for your
      subscription, such as concealing your email address from the
      group.&nbsp; (I think I'd still be able to find out your
      email address, since I administer the list, but you'd just
      have to live with that.)<br>
      <br>
      You might also want to look at Orbiter NASSP's Virtual AGC
      mailing list, where they seem to be making great progress on
      the practical details of actually using the AGC for running
      simulated missions.&nbsp; Highly recommended if you're more
      interested in running the AGC rather than understanding its
      guts!&nbsp; Unfortunately, I never seem to be able to find it
      myself from one time to the next, so I don't have a handy
      link to give you; you'll have to google it yourself.<br>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Wow, where did you get all this material, and how can I find
  some too?<br></h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    If you want to collect AGC documentation and software in a
    secret shrine where you can admire it without sharing the
    content with anybody else, please don't.&nbsp; Sometimes you
    can find this stuff on eBay.&nbsp; There are also auctioneers
    who buy and sell this stuff.&nbsp; Obviously, we (Virtual AGC)
    can't afford to buy it there or anywhere else, but if you find
    yourself doing so please consider sending us a digital
    copy.&nbsp; The value of your collectable won't be dimished and
    you'd be doing a public service.<br>
    <br>
    Sadly, a lot of information that would be very helpful for this
    project does not seem to be publically available on the
    Internet. &nbsp;For example, where is a dimensioned drawing of
    the DSKY? &nbsp;What connector types were used for feeding
    external signals to the AGC, what was the pinout of the
    connectors, and what were the electrical characteristics of
    those signals? &nbsp;Where are additional source-code versions
    of <b>Luminary</b> or <b>Colossus</b> ... or of
    <b>Sundance</b>&nbsp; (alternate CM software)? &nbsp;(I could
    go on like this all day.) &nbsp;Alas! I don't know the answers
    to these and many other questions. &nbsp;One can only hope that
    the materials still exist somewhere and may become available
    someday.&nbsp; <a href="QuestForInfo.html">If you would like
    some hints about where this kind of information may be lurking,
    click here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    Fortunately, just enough information has been readily available
    to allow development of Virtual AGC.&nbsp; All of the materials
    we've collected are available from our <a href=
    "links.html">document library page</a>.<br>
  </div>
  <h2>I have some of the documentation you need, but what can I do
  with it?</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    A pretty complete description of the available options can be
    found on our <a href="HowToDigitize.html">"how to digitize"
    page</a>.<br>
  </div>
  <h2>Is this project affiliated somehow with NASA, or Draper Labs,
  or TRW Aerospace, or IBM, or ... are any former Apollo workers
  involved?</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    No, not in terms of running it or providing any of the
    simulation software.&nbsp; However, in latter years it has been
    gratifying to see contributions of archived AGC documentation
    and program listings by various of the original AGC
    developers.<br>
  </div>
  <h2>And who the heck are you, anyway?</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    Well, I'm not involved in the space program in any way.&nbsp;
    Professionally, I write embedded software for airborne
    devices.&nbsp; I have a number of other open-source projects,
    which you can read about (along with a more-extended write-up
    about me, Me, ME!) at <a href="http://www.sandroid.org">my main
    website</a>.<br>
    <br>
    And yes, somebody really did ask this.<br>
  </div>
  <h2>Why waste so much time on a project that may be of interest
  to 3 geeks somewhere?</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    Placing men on the moon is one of the greatest accomplishments
    of the United States of America.&nbsp; It is arguable, indeed,
    that it is the <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">greatest</span> accomplishment (of any
    kind) in the history of the human race.&nbsp; If so, perhaps it
    makes sense to preserve the relics of the Apollo project.&nbsp;
    (Besides, I'm one of the 3. )<br>
    <br>
    I got the idea while watching the movie <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">Apollo 13</span>.&nbsp; The instant in
    the movie where the AGC is powered up on Earth approach is the
    instant when the viewer suddenly feels that survival of the
    astronauts has changed from "highly unlikely" to "very
    probable".&nbsp; It gives me a chill whenever I see it.&nbsp;
    Anyhow, on watching this one day, it struck me that it was a
    shame nobody knew any longer how to operate the AGC—let alone
    write the programs for it.&nbsp; (As it happens, that thought
    was a bit premature:&nbsp; only 35 years had passed since the
    AGC software was written, thus many of the original software
    developers were still <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">reasonably</span> young.&nbsp;
    Nevertheless, the principle is correct, since <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">very few</span> people could use or
    program the AGC.)&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, it then occurred to me that it would be cool to bring
    the AGC back to life, and to allow anyone so inclined to use it
    or program it ... assuming, of course, that sufficient
    publically information was available to do so.&nbsp; As it
    quickly turned out, there was enough information publically
    available, though <span style="font-style: italic;">just
    barely</span> enough.&nbsp; The project turns out to be an
    interesting experiment in digital archaeology.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">News flash</span>:&nbsp; I
    found a couple more geeks, bringing the total to 5.&nbsp;
    Here's their <a href=
    "http://www.calsoft.de/%7Echristian/AGC/">website</a>, where
    they're doing almost the same thing as me, inspired (no less)
    by <span style="font-style: italic;">From the Earth to the
    Moon</span>.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Later news
    flash:</span>&nbsp; I've found still more geeks.&nbsp; Let's
    just assume that the total is around 100 and do away with these
    further news flashes!<br>
  </div>
  <h2>Tom Hanks, Wherever You Are, Call Me!</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    I jest, of course.&nbsp; But I suspect that if Tom Hanks (a
    well-known space buff) had an assistant make a few judicious
    telephone calls to people hoarding the AGC-related information
    we need to advance this project, it could accomplish more in a
    few hours than years of knocking on doors by me has
    accomplished.<br>
    <br>
    If you know someone like Tom (or know someone who knows someone
    like Tom) who might be sympathetic, pass the word along to
    them.<br>
  </div>
  <h2>What's with the "ya" stuff all over the place?</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    Computer programmers are aware—though Apollo enthusiasts may
    not be—that "ya" is often added to computer program names to
    mean "yet another".&nbsp; Thus, <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> is "yet another <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">YUL</span>", <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> is "yet another <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">DSKY</span>", and so on.&nbsp;<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HENRY 6, ACT 2, SCENE 4<br></span>
  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <br>
    It turns out, though, that the authors' literary skills didn't
    quite match their programming skills, as this quote is really
    from Henry VI, Part 2, Act IV, Scene VII.&nbsp; (Thanks to
    Frank O'Brien of the Apollo Flight Journal and Apollo Lunar
    Surface Journal for this correction.)&nbsp; By the way, if you
    take it upon yourself to actually read the play to figure out
    the context, you may find yourself reading about "a Nowne and a
    Verbe" rather than "a noun and a verb".<br>
    <br>
    Original AGC hardware developer Ramón Alonso provides a little
    more insight:&nbsp; Apparently, nobody had yet arrived at any
    kind of software requirements for the AGC's user interface when
    the desire arose within the Instrumentation Laboratory to set
    up a demo guidance-computer unit with which to impress visitors
    to the lab.&nbsp; Of course, this demo would have to
    <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> something, if it
    was going to be at all impressive, and to do something it would
    need some software. In short order, some of the coders threw
    together a demo program, inventing and using the verb/noun
    user-interface concept (in the whimsical fashion seen in much
    of this code), but without any idea that the verb/noun concept
    would somehow survive into the flight software.&nbsp; As time
    passed, and more and more people became familiar with the demo,
    nobody got around to inventing an improvement for the user
    interface, so the coders simply built it into the flight
    software without any specific requirements to do so.<br>
    <br>
    However, that does not mean that the verb/noun interface was
    universally beloved.&nbsp; Ramón says that <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">many</span> objections were received from
    naysayers, such as "it's not scientific", "it's not dignified",
    or even "astronauts won't understand it".&nbsp; Even though the
    coders of the demo hadn't seriously intended the verb/noun
    interface to be used in any permanent way, it became a kind of
    devilish game to counter these objections with (perhaps)
    sophistic arguments as to why the interface was really a good
    one.&nbsp; In the end, the coders won.&nbsp; I don't know
    whether they were elated or dismayed by this victory.<br>
    <br>
    The astronauts, of course, <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">could</span> understand the interface,
    but they did not like it.&nbsp; Most of them really wanted an
    interface much more like that they had used in aircraft:&nbsp;
    i.e., lots of dials and switches.&nbsp; Dave Scott is the the
    only astronaut I'm aware of who had kind words for it (or for
    the AGC in general), though we are told that Jim McDivitt
    wasn't necessary completely hostile to it.<br>
  </div>
  <h2>Why Isn't More Information Provided About Why the Guidance
  System User Interface Was Like it Was?</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    A lot of thought about usability went into the design of the
    guidance system, much more so than the story above about verbs
    and nouns would indicate.&nbsp; Questions like what kinds of
    controls needed to be provided, or even <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">where</span> those controls would be
    physically located, were extremely important&nbsp; (Thanks to
    George Silver for pointing this out.)&nbsp; Sadly, I don't know
    anything about these topics, and that's why I don't cover them
    here.<br>
  </div>
  <h2>Tell Us More Amusing Stories</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    Well ... maybe just a couple more.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The story of the 1201 and 1202 alarms on the descent by
      Armstrong and Aldrin to the lunar surface during Apollo 11 is
      well known.&nbsp; (If you don't know it, the astronauts
      received repeated alarms from the AGC of type 1201 and 1202
      -- 5 alarms in all, if I'm not mistaken.&nbsp; On each alarm,
      the question was raised as to whether to continue or to
      abort.&nbsp; Obviously, they continued.)&nbsp; I'm informed
      that the representative from the MIT Instrumentation Lab who
      was present to be consulted by Mission Control was Russ
      Larson.&nbsp; When consulted on the go/no-go question, Larson
      simply gave a "thumbs up" signal.&nbsp; When asked years
      later why he had done this, he said simply that he was too
      scared to speak.&nbsp; (Thanks to Allan Klumpp for this
      story.)</li>
      <li>And continuing on the topic of the 1201/1202 alarms in
      Apollo 11:&nbsp; These alarms were caused by the fact that
      during the landing, both the landing radar <span style=
      "font-style: italic;">and</span> the rendezvous radar were
      turned on.&nbsp; Only the landing radar actually needed to be
      active, but it was felt by some that having the rendezvous
      radar turned on would be useful in case of a sudden
      abort.&nbsp; What wasn't known was that this extra load on
      the AGC CPU would cause it to run out of processing
      cycles.&nbsp; The software would work all right at first, but
      eventually the loss of about 15% of the CPU cycles due to
      processing the excess radar data would cause some tasks to be
      spawned before earlier instances of those tasks had completed
      running.&nbsp; Eventually, because of the duplication of
      tasks, the software would be unable to allocate the memory
      needed to spawn new tasks, and would need to restart.&nbsp;
      Fortunately, the cunning design of the software allowed the
      software to basically continue executing at the same point
      where it had been before restarting, and so it could continue
      operating normally until it ran out of memory again.&nbsp;
      Eldon Hall likes to point out that this is a <span style=
      "font-style: italic;">success</span> of the AGC rather than a
      failure (as some <span style=
      "font-style: italic;">other</span> people like to say).&nbsp;
      At any rate, Allan Klumpp coded a workaround for this problem
      in time for the Apollo 13 mission, but the powers-that-be
      declined to use the new software.&nbsp; Klumpp was upset
      enough about this to contact the mission commander, Jim
      Lovell, and describe why the new software (Luminary 131)
      would be so much better than the old.&nbsp; The next morning,
      Dick Battin dropped by Klumpp's office and announced, "Allan
      Klumpp, your political <span style=
      "font-style: italic;">savoire-faire</span> has descended to a
      new low!"&nbsp; That was his way of saying that Luminary 131
      would be used on Apollo 13 after all, because Jim Lovell
      wanted it.</li>
      <li>The original source code for the AGC assembler program
      called "YUL" isn't presently publicly available, though I
      expect it will be soon, and I'll link to it when it is.&nbsp;
      However, <a href="Yul2pages.pdf">here is a scan</a> of pages
      2 and 3 of the listing for YUL.&nbsp; Please examine it
      closely.&nbsp; I needn't comment further.<br></li>
      <li>Not an AGC story, but I like it:&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm told
      that one of the perks of writing software at MSC in the
      Apollo era was taking&nbsp;the coding sheets to the 'swamp'
      for the keypunch operators to build the card decks to be
      taken to the computer center.&nbsp; The 'swamp' was a tiered
      auditorium with many young women at keypunch machines on the
      tiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the young engineers would enter
      the room at the front at what was the focus of the tiers,
      feeling a little like a bull at the rodeo auction.&nbsp;
      Apparently, this was a good way to meet bored young women in
      need of stimulation.&nbsp; This is a case, obviously, where
      progress has been in completely the wrong direction.&nbsp;
      (Thanks to Paul Schlein for this story.)</li>
      <li>When the disks containing the Apollo 11 assembly listings
      arrived (May 2009), the shipping clerk who handed the box to
      me asked if it contained a software update.&nbsp; I informed
      him that it did.&nbsp; That it was a very old software update
      ... in fact, perhaps the oldest software update in the
      history of the world.&nbsp; And you know what?&nbsp; I think
      it may actually be true.<br></li>

  <h2>Wouldn't it be better to incorporate Virtual AGC into a
  flight simulation or lunar landing simulation?</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    Yes.&nbsp; I would strongly encourage it.&nbsp; But it's
    outside of my personal limits, workload-wise.&nbsp; If you want
    to work on that, I may be able to connect you to other people
    who are also interested in doing so.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    If you do want to work on this, I'd <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">strongly</span> advise that you use (or
    adapt and improve) the socket-based interconnect model I've
    provided and described on the <a href=
    "developer.html">developer page</a> (so that yaAGC can be used
    as a stand-alone program), rather than trying to cut-and-paste
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> code into the
    flight-simulator.&nbsp; Remember that even though Virtual AGC
    is free of cost, you are still bound by the licensing
    provisions of the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">General Public
    License</a> (GPL); in other words, there are consequences for
    misuse of the code.&nbsp; If, for example, you insert
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> code into a
    flight simulator, then that flight simulator must also be
    open-sourced under the GPL, or else I would have to grant you a
    special exception to the license.&nbsp; (For example, I have
    granted such an exception for the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Orbiter</span> program.&nbsp; See
    below.)&nbsp; On the other hand, if you use <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> as a stand-alone program that
    merely communicates with the flight simulator, then there is no
    such problem.&nbsp; Remember also that Virtual AGC is a
    work-in-progress, and if you insist on customizing <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> itself, you will have to
    carefully consider what you intend to do when I improve it
    without consulting you, and you have no way to merge the
    changes.<br>
    <br>
    Work to integrate Virtual AGC into the <a href=
    "http://www.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/%7Emartins/orbit/orbit.html">Orbiter</a>
    spacecraft simulator has proceeded marvelously.&nbsp; There is
    a Sourceforge project, complete with working code and
    documentation such as installation instructions.<br>
    <br>
    I'm told that integration into <a href=
    "http://www.flightgear.org/">FlightGear</a> is proceeding well
    also, though I have not heard anything about it for several
    years.<br>
  </div>
  <h2>How come the stuff the simulation can do is so trivial?</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    It takes more than just a computer to fly an Apollo LM or
    CM.&nbsp; At the very least, you need simulations of the
    spacecraft's IMU, AOT, and of the physical spacecraft (i.e.,
    acceleration, torque, fuel usage, etc.).&nbsp; Maybe we'll have
    those things, one of these days.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href=
    "yaTelemetry.html"><span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span></a> module has made a
    good start towards providing some of these things.<br>
  </div>
  <h2>It doesn't work!&nbsp; How do I make it work?</h2>
  <h3>It's Too Slow!</h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    At the moment, Virtual AGC consists of two parts:&nbsp; the
    core programs (like <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>, <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>, etc.) and the contributed
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>
    program.&nbsp; I separate them because very different
    techniques and tools were used for creating them, so they don't
    contribute to slowing down you computer in the same way.&nbsp;
    Furthermore, the contributions of the various parts are
    different on different platforms.&nbsp; Here are some
    approximate timings I've made using the 20050716 development
    snapshot:<br>

    While the benchmarks above are very far out of date
    technology-wise by now, they are still somewhat
    instructive.&nbsp; What you'll notice, undoubtedly, is that the
    simulation is going to need a relatively modern system to run
    all of the bits and pieces.&nbsp; If you don't have a fast
    enough CPU, it doesn't observably affect the core programs, but
    has the symptom that <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> slows to a crawl, and
    responds increasingly slowly as time goes on, because the
    backlog of unprocessed data increases.<br>
    <br>
    So what is to be done about this?&nbsp; Well, I'm sure that
    over time we'll be able to improve the speed of these programs,
    but that's not of any immediate help to you.&nbsp; One thing
    you can do immediately, assuming you have the resources, is to
    take advantage of Virtual AGC's client-server
    architecture.&nbsp; You can do things like running <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> on one computer, and
    the core programs on another computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Splitting up
    the bits and pieces this way has the additional advantage (if
    each computer has its own monitor) of making it easier to see
    all of the various controls without having them obscure each
    other.<br>
    <br>
    Of course, if you're so inclined, you could also roll up your
    sleeves, pitch in, and help us figure out how to speed up the
    simulation programs.<br>
  </div>
  <h3><a name="Troubleshooting" id=
  "Troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting Running the
  Simulation<br></h3>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    Various things to to look out for are found in the <a href=
    "download.html#Some_platform-specific_odditities">quirks
    list</a>, but here's a separate, supplemental list just to make
    it even more confusing:<br>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>If you're running the simulation by separately running
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> rather than through the
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI,
    remember that the two programs have to be run from two
    different command-line windows.&nbsp; A reason why you might
    <span style="font-style: italic;">want</span> to do this is
    that on some slow Win32 systems, there are some timing problems
    if the startup scripts are used.<br></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> enforces
    a certain ordering in the way the various components of the
    simulation start up.&nbsp; If you bypass <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>, you should note that
    there some are some quirks in the startup and shutdown ordering
    of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>.&nbsp; If you
    <span style="font-style: italic;">don't</span> stick to my
    recommended ordering, you will probably encounter
    problems.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">In
    Win32</span>:&nbsp; You can't start peripherals before you
    start <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>; if you do,
    the programs will not be able to communicate amongst
    themselves.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">In Linux
    (pre-20050131)</span>:&nbsp; You can't terminate <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> before terminating
    peripherals; if you do, there will be a timeout (which may be a
    minute or two) before the operating system allows the port
    connecting the simulated CPU and peripherals to be
    reused.&nbsp; (In Win32, command "<span style=
    "font-family: monospace;">netstat -a</span>" --- or in Linux,
    the command "<span style="font-family: monospace;">netstat -a |
    grep 19697</span>" --- is useful for detecting this
    condition.)&nbsp; The startup/shutdown procedure I'd recommend
    for both platforms is:<br></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Start <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.</li>
      <li>Start all peripherals (like <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>).</li>
      <li>Use to your heart's content.<br></li>
      <li>Stop all peripherals (like <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>).</li>
      <li>Stop <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Startup of the <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> component, which is
    written in the Tcl/Tk scripting language, has always been
    problematic:&nbsp; If it doesn't connect within a certain
    limited time, it will abort, and if the simulation is being run
    from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI
    it will generally cause the entire simulation to abort.&nbsp;
    One thing that seems to help is to delay startup of
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> for
    several seconds, to insure that <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> is up and waiting for
    connections before <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> even tries to
    connect.<br></li>
    <li>The main place (I think/hope) where things could go wrong
    would be in the TCP socket interface connecting <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>.&nbsp; If some other service
    on your computer was already using port 19697—if, for example,
    you were simultaneously running two copies of <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> or <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>—then there could be a
    problem.&nbsp; You can check this by closing out all instances
    of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDKSY</span> (in Win32 with
    ctrl-alt-del, or in Linux with "<span style=
    "font-family: monospace;">killall -KILL yaDSKY</span>" and
    "<span style="font-family: monospace;">killall -KILL
    yaAGC</span>"), and then trying this:&nbsp; "<span style=
    "font-family: monospace;">telnet localhost 19697</span>".&nbsp;
    If telnet says it connected to something, then you definitely
    have another service using this port, and you can work around
    it with the --port command-line switch of <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> to choose a new port.&nbsp;
    If not, then you probably don't, and that's not the cause of
    your problem.</li>
    <li>Another possibility, I suppose, is that you may have a
    personal firewall installed which is blocking port 19697.&nbsp;
    In that case, you'll have to reconfigure the firewall.</li>
    <li>Perhaps your computer is not even set up properly for
    networking, which is necessary for any of the socket-based
    communications to work.&nbsp; For example, you may not have an
    Ethernet card.&nbsp; <a href="NoNIC.txt">These comments</a>
    from Joe Durnavich (thanks Joe!) may help if you have this
    problem and you're using Linux.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How do I Uninstall this Thing?</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    On Linux or Windows, an uninstaller program is provided when
    the installer program is run.&nbsp; Alternately—if installed on
    Mac OS X or from source code—simply remove the installation
    directories which were created.&nbsp; Unless you've renamed
    them, these will be folders with names like "yaAGC/" (dev
    snapshot), "VirtualAGC/" (Linux binaries), "Virtual AGC\"
    (Windows binaries), or "VirtualAGC.app/" (Mac OS X binaries. On
    very old versions, in Linux or Mac OS X, the installation
    directory might have been "~/.yaAGC".<br>

  <h2>What about GitHub Repositories?</h2>

    <p>At the time I'm writing this (July 2016), Chris Garry's AGC
    source-code repository has gotten a lot of press, and I've
    gotten some mail in regard to it.&nbsp; I'm not involved with
    it, but my understanding is that it is clone of some of the AGC
    source files here at Virtual AGC, but with the distinction that
    Chris has an active group of volunteers (more active than here,
    anyway!) who are helping to track down discrepancies between
    those source files and the page-images we've made of the
    original printouts of those program listings.&nbsp; The
    discrepancies are expected to relate entirely to comments in
    the source code and not to any actual software.&nbsp; I'm not

    The NASA Office of Logic Design has various interesting
    AGC-related documents online.&nbsp; There's not a lot of unique
    content yet, but strides are being made and it looks like there
    soon will be, so it's worth checking out.</strike>&nbsp; (Now a
    zombie for all practical purposes, unfortunately, and hopefully
    most of significant AGC-related content has migrated
    here.)<br></li>
    <li><a href=
    "http://www.geocities.com/bobandrepont/spacepdf.htm">bobandrepont/spacepdf.htm</a>.&nbsp;
    A site which links an interesting collection of Apollo (and
    Mercury, Gemini, and shuttle) docs from a diverse set of
    websites.<br></li>
    <li>
    <strike>www-lib.ksc.nasa.gov/lib/presskits.html</strike><strike>.&nbsp;
    The Kennedy Space Center Library has press kits for all of the
    missions.</strike>&nbsp; (Now moved somewhere else, I
    guess.)<br></li>
    <li><strike>apollo.spaceborn.dk/dsky-sim.html</strike><strike>.
    &nbsp;A very nice Apollo site, with the highlight (for my
    purposes) being a simple little Javascript emulation of a
    DSKY.</strike>&nbsp; (Now defunct.)<br></li>
    <li><a href=
    "http://www.apollosaturn.com/">www.apollosaturn.com</a>.&nbsp;
    Lots of useful miscellaneous info, including spacecraft
    photos.</li>
    <li><a href=
    "http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history">www.jsc.nasa.gov/history</a>.&nbsp;
    This site doesn't contain any actual materials of interest to
    Virtual AGC, as far as I can tell, but it's very useful in
    figuring out where existing records from Apollo are physically
    located.</li>
    <li><a href=
    "http://perso.wanadoo.fr/max.q/main.htm">perso.wanadoo.fr/max.q/main.htm</a>.&nbsp;
    An excellent general-purpose Apollo site with some unusual
    miscellaneous information (such as Block I DSKY photos).&nbsp;
    You need to read French, though, which I unfortunately do
    not.<br></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.doneyles.com/LM/Tales.html">"Tales from

    terrific talk by Don Eyles, covering the infamous Apollo 11
    1202 alarms, the Apollo 14 solder-ball incident, and
    more.<br></li>
    <li>And last, but not least, the <a href=
    "http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/">Apollo Lunar Surface Journal</a>
    and <a href=

    managed to find their way here already knows all about them
    anyhow.</li>

    <li><a href="http://svtsim.com/moonjs/agc.html">Shariar
    Iravanian's javascript-based online AGC+DSKY+IMU

    it "wasn't ready to be released into the wild", but since a
    couple of people sent me links to it within a half-hour period,
    I guess it must be.&nbsp; At any rate, it certainly looks
    classy.&nbsp; check it out!<br></li>
    <li>John Pultorak has recreated a <span style=

    some of its software and back-ported some Block II software to

    Here are links to some apparently pretty realistic full-feature
    LM simulations, but (of course) without true AGC simulations
    except insofar as efforts have been made to integrate Virtual
    AGC with them.&nbsp; (I've not tried any of them myself, except
    for briefly messing with Orbiter.)<br>

    is work being done to integrate Virtual AGC into the CSM
    portion of the NASSP add-on, started by Mark Grant and
    continued by Markus Joachim.&nbsp; Apparently, that work is at
    or near a usable (if not complete) state, which in my
    (admittedly prejudiced) view is very cool.&nbsp; Here is the
    latest word I have on it from Markus (with a little editing

    Chichester, UK: Springer/Praxis Publishing, 2010.&nbsp; The
    title says it all.&nbsp; I think you'll find this to be a very
    readable book, somewhat like a much kinder, gentler form of
    this website in terms of the material presented.&nbsp;
    Conversely, some of the material on this website came from
    Frank originally, so I guess what goes around comes

    interested in the stuff on my website, buy this book and read

    from the title.&nbsp; I have an autographed copy, purchased
    from the author.&nbsp; The sign on the table read, roughly,
    "Signed by the author -- $50.&nbsp; Unsigned -- $55."&nbsp;

    Films</a> has a series of DVD-sets containing the films,
    television transmissions, still photos, and numerous other
    materials for various missions---Apollo 8, 11, 15, 16, and 17
    as of this writing.&nbsp; I've seen the Apollo 11 and Apollo 15
    sets, and would recommend them for enthusiasts (but not for the
    friends and families of enthusiasts).&nbsp; The Gemini films,
    on the other hand, seem extremely compelling.&nbsp; One reader,
    Eugene Dorr, writes with rave reviews about a video called
    "Mission to the Moon", which is a 2-DVD set of documentaries;
    the star of the show (he tells us) is a half-hour film called
    "Computer for Apollo", which includes a demonstration of the
    AGC, as well as "a totally engrossing demonstration of how the
    AGC was manufactured."&nbsp; I guess I should go an buy it
    myself, right now!</li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">In the Shadow of the
    Moon</span> is a terrific documentary by David Sington on the
    various lunar missions, consisting principally of interview
    material with a large number of Apollo astronauts.&nbsp; It
    doesn't really have anything to do with the AGC, but I'd
    recommend it highly anyway.</li>

  <h2>Is the moon landing a hoax?</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    Yes, though I've removed all references to the hoax from the
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span> and
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> source
    code.&nbsp; (Joke!)&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    But I must congratulate those 1960s tricksters on their
    attention to detail, such as seeding copies of software
    listings for various versions of the AGC software in people's
    homes, museums, and what-not, so as to send me on expensive
    merry chases to find them and make them publicly available 40
    years later.&nbsp; And to do it in such a way that with my
    dull, cowlike mentality I can't perceive the fakery in
    it.&nbsp; Usually it takes a beautiful woman or somebody waving
    a fistful of dollars at me to deceive me so badly.&nbsp; I
    mean, the gosh-darn software actually works when you run
    it!&nbsp; You really have to admire the level of commitment
    those evil geniuses had back then.&nbsp; I doubt that today we
    even retain the skills to fake anything so thoroughly.&nbsp;
    That's why former President Bush's bravado about (faking) a
    return to the moon or visit to Mars is doomed to failure.&nbsp;
    :)<br>
    <br>
    But seriously, I've found the blog of some thinker who has used
    the existence of our Virtual AGC project itself as <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">evidence</span> that the moon landing was
    faked.&nbsp; His reasoning goes as follows:&nbsp; a) Virtual
    AGC simulates some Apollo hardware; b) therefore, it is
    <span style="font-style: italic;">possible</span> to simulate
    Apollo missions; and c) therefore Apollo missions <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">were</span> fake 40 years ago.&nbsp;
    Well, you hardly need Virtual AGC as a step in that reasoning,
    since lots of people already know that the astronauts trained
    extensively in simulated spacecraft.&nbsp; The simulators being
    used in the 1960s and 70s were far better and more accurate
    than our 21st-century software-only simulations.<br>
    <br>
    Amusingly to me, the Virtual AGC project has <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">also</span> been used as a
    counter-argument to those who believe in the hoax theory.&nbsp;
    I quite like <a href=
    "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bic-z2b0mSU">a YouTube
    video</a> in which a Microsoft Windows based compilation of our
    AGC assembler (<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>)
    is performed, and then <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> is used to assemble one of
    the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span> or
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
    programs.&nbsp; Too bad the demonstration stops short of
    actually running the simulated system.&nbsp; The video is well
    worth watching, but I'm merely giving the link for rather than
    embedding the video itself within in this page, because there
    is an audio track that might startle those around you if you
    happened to be reading this page while on a break at your
    workplace.&nbsp; Anyway, a claim had been made that
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span> and
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> were not real
    programs, or something of that sort, and the demo video is
    supposed to debunk that by showing the the programs not only
    exist as scanned program listings, but can also be
    assembled.&nbsp; Naturally, this was not very conclusive as far
    as the believer whose argument being debunked was
    concerned.<br>
