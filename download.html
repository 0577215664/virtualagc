  <h2><a name="Introduction" id=
  "Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This page covers various ways to download and/or install
  Virtual AGC project software.&nbsp; Three methods are currently
  recommended, and a fourth is possible if not really
  recommended:<br></p>
  <ol>
    <li>If you simply wish to <i>run</i> one of the provided AGC or
    AEA simulations, examine the AGC or AEA program code, and/or do
    visual debugging of (Block II) AGC code, then the easiest thing
    to do is to <a href="#Downloading_Running_or_Updating">download
    and run the provided VirtualBox virtual machine</a>.&nbsp; The
    VM is guaranteed to work properly on any 32-bit or 64-bit 'x86
    platform for which VirtualBox is available, namely Windows,
    Mac, Linux, and Solaris, and (<a href=
    "https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/virtualization-host-virtualbox.html">according
    to this page</a>) FreeBSD as well even though the latter is not
    obvious from the VirtualBox website.<br></li>
    <li>If you just happen to have a computer system which is
    currently supported by an installation package, then you can
    <a href="#Platforms_Directly_Supported_by">simply download and
    install the proper installation package</a>.&nbsp; At present,
    however, these platforms are only the following:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Raspberry Pi</li>
      <li>Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit 'x86.<br></li>
    </ol>
    <li>If you wish to do not only the above, but also wish to
    delve more deeply into the Virtual AGC project code (as opposed
    to just the AGC/AEA code), then you should instead <a href=
    "#Downloading_and_Building_Virtual_AGC">download the Virtual
    AGC source code, and perhaps build it yourself</a>.&nbsp; This
    works on many more platforms, though is more-involved to set
    up, and visual AGC debugging may not be possible easily on
    platforms other than 'x86 Windows, Mac, or Linux.<br></li>
    <li>If you are satisfied with <i>older</i> versions of Virtual
    AGC, many additional computer platforms were once directly
    supported with installer programs, which you can still find
    <a href="download-less-old.html">here</a> or <a href=
    "download-old.html">here</a>.&nbsp; Ideally, we would like to
    directly support all major platforms with Virtual AGC installer
    programs, but in practice it is far too hard to do so with the
    resources available at present, so this is no longer being done
    currently.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Note that a lot of detail about known quirks on different
  platforms, and about trouble-shooting, can be found at the older
  links listed in approach #4 above, but isn't found on the present
  page.&nbsp; That's because the information hasn't been updated in
  so long that its reliability is dubious, and because many of the
  platforms mentioned there are long-obsolete.&nbsp; It should also
  be noted that the build-instructions for some platforms presented
  here are similarly out-of-date and may need corrections.<br></p>

  <h3><a name="Characteristics_of_the_Virtual_AGC_VM" id=
  "Characteristics_of_the_Virtual_AGC_VM"></a>Characteristics of
  the Virtual AGC VM<br></h3>
  <p>The approach described here should work with any host system
  supported by <a href=
  "http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>:&nbsp; namely, any
  32-bit or 64-bit 'x86 version of Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris, or
  FreeBSD.&nbsp; It's nice because it lets you work with the
  most-commonly-desired elements of Virtual AGC, while skipping
  past the most-annoying and tricky setup steps, such as compiling
  Virtual AGC's source code.&nbsp; It provides you with a "virtual
  machine", with Virtual AGC and other things you need in order to
  be able to work with Virtual AGC already pre-installed and
  pre-configured.<br></p>
  <p>When the VM is run, the first thing you see is the VirtualAGC
  GUI, from which you can run an AGC simulation using various
  selectable options, browse nicely syntax-highlighted AGC source
  code, or various other things.&nbsp; In the screenshots below,
  you'll also notice a "website" desktop icon, which lets you
  browse to the website you happen to be looking at right at this
  instant not a big deal (you're already doing it, right?), but
  convenient for making downloads directly into the VM.<br></p>

  <p align="left">The other main thing the VM allows you to do is
  to work with the AGC source code in <a href=
  "http://codeblocks.org/">Code::Blocks</a>.&nbsp; Code::Blocks is
  an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which means that you
  can edit the AGC source code and reassemble it ... but more
  importantly, it means you can <i>visually debug</i> it: i.e.,
  single-step through the AGC code, examine AGC variables, and so
  forth, so that you can get a very intimate understanding of how
  the AGC code works, if that's something that interests you.&nbsp;
  Most of the desktop icons in the images above are for debugging
  the various versions of AGC code in Code::Blocks.&nbsp; For
  example, in the VM screenshot below, the Luminary 131 (Apollo 13
  LM) code is being debugged, and the program is at line 379 (the
  <tt>EXTEND</tt> instruction) of the Fresh Start and Restart
  section of the code.<br></p>

  "530" border="2" width="720"></a><br></p>
  <p>Okay, enough of the sales pitch already!&nbsp; What's do you
  actually have to do to install the thing?<br></p>
  <h3><a name="Installation_of_the_Virtual_AGC_VM_" id=
  "Installation_of_the_Virtual_AGC_VM_"></a>Installation of the
  Virtual AGC VM<br></h3>
  <p>It's hard to pin down exactly what computer resources you'll
  need to run the VM.&nbsp; The minimum is probably around 2 GB of
  RAM and 12GB of free disk space, but the more of everything you
  have, the better.&nbsp; In particular, you will have a far more
  satisfactory experience if your CPU has <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization">VT-x (Intel)
  or AMD-V (AMD) extensions</a>.&nbsp; The VM itself requires only
  about 5GB of disk space, but in the process of decompressing the
  downloaded VM, you'll temporarily need a lot more (hence the 12GB
  mentioned).<br></p>
  <p>Before doing anything with Virtual AGC as such, you should
  take care of the following:<br></p>
  <ul>
    <li>If VirtualBox is not already installed, <a href=
    "https://www.virtualbox.org">download and install
    VirtualBox</a>, using whatever version is suitable for your
    computer system.&nbsp; The Virtual AGC virtual machine (VM) you
    will download was created with <a href=
    "https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_3">VirtualBox
    4.3.40</a>, but it should work with later versions as
    well.</li>
    <li>The VM is compressed in tar.7z form for downloading, so if
    your operating system doesn't already have software support for
    tar.7z archives, you need to install extra software that
    provides it.&nbsp; In Linux, you're probably okay without doing
    anything, or at worst just using your distribution's software
    repository.&nbsp; For other platforms, a little googling
    reveals that the program <a href=
    "http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> provides tar.7z
    for Windows, and there are "unofficial" installers for Mac,
    Solaris, and FreeBSD.&nbsp; However, various other programs
    work as well, I think, such as <a href=
    "http://www.winzip.com/win/en/index.htm">WinZip</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Then to actually install the VirtualAGC VM, you do the
  following.<br></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Download the current compressed VM, as listed at the top of
    this page.<br></li>
    <li>Uncompress it, resulting in a folder called
    "VirtualAGC-runtime".&nbsp; This may (or may not) be a 2-step
    process, in which the .tar.7z file is first uncompressed into a
    .tar file, which in turn needs to be uncompressed to get the
    mentioned folder.&nbsp; The .tar.7z (and .tar) file are no
    longer used after that and may be deleted ... though obviously
    <i>we'd</i> prefer you retained it for a while to make sure you
    don't need to download it again if some mishap occurs.&nbsp;
    VirtualBox tends to store all of its virtual machines in the
    same folder (on Linux, for example, that folder is
    "~/VirtualBox VMs"), so although it's not necessary to do so,
    you might want to move the VirtualAGC-runtime folder into the
    corresponding "VirtualBox VMs" folder on your computer.</li>
    <li>In whatever file-system browser your computer has, descend
    into the VirtualAGC-runtime folder, and double-click the mouse
    on the file VirtualAGC-runtime.vbox.&nbsp; This makes
    VirtualBox aware of your VM, and may or may not actually
    immediately run it.&nbsp; At any rate, the VM will be visible
    in VirtualBox's manager program, and you can run it from
    there.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In its as-downloaded form, the VM is typically configured to
  use 1GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores.&nbsp; You can dial these settings
  down in VirtualBox, but you may need to scale your expectations
  at the same time.&nbsp; For example, with 512GB of RAM and 1 CPU
  core, you may find that simulation and debugging works perfectly
  fine, but browsing the source code may be miserable, due to the
  fact that modern browsers (Mozilla Firefox is what's included in
  the VM) take enormous amounts of RAM.<br></p>
  <p>Note that username and password for the VM are both
  "virtualagc".&nbsp; Since you are automatically logged in
  whenever you run the VM, you don't normally need this
  information, but it's good to know just in case (for example) you
  ever need to install some new, non-Virtual-AGC software on it, or
  perform some other administrative action.</p>
  <h3><a name="Updating_the_Virtual_AGC_VM" id=
  "Updating_the_Virtual_AGC_VM"></a>Updating the Virtual AGC
  VM</h3>
  <p>Because the VM is such a large download, you don't want to
  have to download it every time there's updated Virtual AGC
  software!<br></p>
  <p>Because the VM is based on 32-bit Ubuntu 14.04, which
  (surprise!) happens to be one of the <a href=
  "#Platforms_Directly_Supported_by">target platforms supported
  directly by a Virtual AGC installer program</a>, the updating the
  VM to new Virtual AGC versions is generally quite simple.&nbsp;
  Do all of the following from <i>within</i> the VM itself:<br></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Exit from the VirtualAGC program, if it's running in the
    VM.&nbsp; (In other words, we just want the VM desktop, without
    any programs running on it.)<br></li>
    <li>Download the current Virtual AGC Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit
    installer, as listed at the top of this page.<a href=
    "http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Download/VirtualAGC-installer"></a></li>
    <li>Make the VirtualAGC-installer executable:&nbsp; right-click
    on it, and on the pop-up list that appears choose
    Properties/Permissions, and change the Execute setting to "Only
    owner".</li>
    <li>Double-click VirtualAGC-installer to run it, accepting all
    of the defaults offered to you by the installer
    program.<br></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="Downloading_and_Building_Virtual_AGC" id=
  "Downloading_and_Building_Virtual_AGC"></a>Downloading and
  Building Virtual AGC from Source</h2>
  <h3><a name="Limitation" id="Limitation"></a>Limitation</h3>
  <p>Building Virtual AGC from source actually has a limitation
  compared to running the VM as described above, which is that
  while the VM is already set up for visual debugging of AGC code
  using Code::Blocks, this capability is not a part of Virtual AGC
  proper.&nbsp; That is, Code::Blocks based AGC debugging has its
  own set of installations, requirements, and setups, distinct from
  those of building Virtual AGC proper ... which is what's
  discussed below.&nbsp; If (once Virtual AGC is built and working
  satisfactorily) you want to do visual debugging, you need to
  install Code::Blocks and should consult <a href=
  "https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/wiki/DevelopmentWithCodeBlocks">
  the instructions for development using Code::Blocks on our GitHub
  wiki</a>, as well as <a href=
  "https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/wiki/VisualDebugging">the
  instructions for visual debugging</a>.<br></p>
  <p>Of course, it also has the limitation that we can't actually
  deal with every platform people might <i>try</i> to use.&nbsp; So
  I make a pretty strong effort to make sure it works on Ubuntu-
  and Debian-based 64-bit 'x86 Linux, which I use every day, and
  occasionally (rarely) try to check that the process still works
  on whatever versions of Raspberry Pi, Windows, Mac OS X, FreeBSD,
  and Solaris it happens to be convenient for me to run
  personally.<br></p>
  <h3><a name="Getting_the_Source_Code_" id=
  "Getting_the_Source_Code_"></a>Getting the Source Code<br></h3>
  <p>The complete up-to-the-moment source code is available from
  <a href=
  "https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc">GitHub</a>.&nbsp;
  There are several ways which one might choose to download it,
  such as <a href=
  "https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/archive/master.zip">in
  a zipfile</a> or using the 'git' program, which in Linux (for
  example) would look like this:<br></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>git clone https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc<br></p>
  </blockquote>In either case, you end up with a folder called
  virtualagc.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  What you do with it after that depends on which platform you
  intend to run Virtual AGC on, and that's the topic of the next
  few sections.&nbsp; It's also possible that <a href=
  "https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc/blob/master/README.md#linux-1">
  the instructions at the GitHub repository</a> may (or may not) be
  more up-to-date than those here.<br>

  These instructions apply to building Virtual AGC on Ubuntu-like
  systems, but are probably directly applicable to most Ubuntu,
  Debian, or Mint desktop systems.&nbsp; They are known to work on
  64-bit Linux Mint 17.3 and 32-bit Ubuntu 14.04.&nbsp; If you have
  a Linux distribution with a different kind of packaging system,
  such as Fedora, you'll probably have to adapt the first step
  somewhat.<br>
  <br>
  One-time setup:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Install various packages:&nbsp; "sudo apt-get install
    libsdl1.2-dev libncurses5-dev liballegro4.4-dev g++
    libgtk2.0-dev libwxgtk2.8-dev".&nbsp; (Sometimes, it's
    liballegro4-dev.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Building Virtual AGC:<br></p>
  <ul>
    <li>In the Virtual AGC source directory, run "make install" or
    "make clean install".&nbsp; (This does not require a 'sudo',
    and you shouldn't use one.)</li>
  </ul>This process creates a desktop icon from which you can run
  Virtual AGC.&nbsp; In some versions of Linux, you will need to
  right-click the icon and indicate that it is "trusted" before it
  will work properly. You can "uninstall" by removing the icon, the
  ~/VirtualAGC folder, and the source-code directory you downloaded
  from GitHub.<br>

  These instructions relate to building Virtual AGC on a Raspberry
  Pi 3 running Raspbian-Jessie, though they're not really specific
  to any particular Pi model.&nbsp; This really isn't any different
  from building it on <a href="#BuildLinux">any other Linux
  system</a>, but I'll go through the steps separately anyway,
  using a completely clean Raspbian installation.&nbsp; Laszlo
  Morocz provided the original instructions.&nbsp;<br>
  <p>One-time setup:<br></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>sudo apt-get install wx2.8-headers libwxgtk2.8-0

  <p>Building Virtual AGC:<br></p>
  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>or perhaps "make clean install" instead.&nbsp; (No
  'sudo' should be used.)&nbsp; This process creates a desktop icon
  from which you can run Virtual AGC.&nbsp; You can "uninstall" by
  removing the icon, the ~/VirtualAGC folder, and the source-code

  The instructions here relate to building Virtual AGC using
  <a href="http://pcbsd.org/download/">PC-BSD 10.3, desktop
  version</a>.&nbsp; That isn't the latest version of FreeBSD
  (version 11), but it's much easier to install than FreeBSD
  proper, and should be 100% equivalent for the same version
  numbers.&nbsp; At any rate, I know nothing about FreeBSD, so my
  instructions may not be the most-efficient ones.&nbsp; The
  executive summary is that the build process works, and VirtualAGC
  acts normally once built.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Setup:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Install 'cmake' and GNU 'make' (gmake) using the "package"
    system, with the command "sudo pkg install cmake gmake".</li>
    <li>Install the "ports" system, if you haven't
    already.<br></li>
    <li>Install wxWidgets 2.8.12, or as close to that 2.8.x version
    as you can get, using the "ports" system:&nbsp; "cd
    /usr/ports/x11-toolkits/wxgtk28" and "sudo make install".</li>
    <li>For whatever reason, the 'wx-config' program is installed
    with a different name.&nbsp; Make a symbolic link with the
    proper name for it somewhere in your path:&nbsp; "mkdir
    $HOME/bin" and "ln -s /usr/local/bin/wxgtk2u-2.8-config
    $HOME/bin/wx-config".&nbsp; If you test this with the command
    "wx-config --list", you should see that the default wxWidgets
    configuration is "gtk2-unicode-release-2.8".<br></li>
    <li><a href="http://liballeg.org/old.html">Download Allegro
    4.4.2</a>, or as close to that 4.4.x version as you can
    get.&nbsp; Prior to building Allegro, I had to do this: "sudo
    ln -s /usr/local/lib/libasound* /usr/lib"; I'm sure there's a
    much cleaner way to handle that problem (namely, that Allegro
    couldn't find libasound), but I don't know what it is.&nbsp; To
    build and install, do this:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>"cd allegro-4.4.2"</li>
      <li>"mkdir Build"</li>
      <li>"cd Build"</li>
      <li>"cmake .."</li>
      <li>"make"</li>
      <li>"sudo make install"</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <p>Building Virtual AGC:<br></p>
  <ul>
    <li>In the Virtual AGC source directory, run "gmake FREEBSD=yes
    install" or "gmake FREEBSD=yes clean install".&nbsp; (Note that
    'sudo' is neither necessary nor desirable.)&nbsp; Note the use
    of 'gmake' rather than just 'make'<br></li>

  The instructions here relate to building Virtual AGC using
  Solaris 11.3.&nbsp; Note that my knowledge of Solaris is mid-way
  between "completely ignorant" and "dangerously misinformed", so
  you have to take what I say with a grain of salt.&nbsp;
  Nevertheless, the executive summary is that the instructions do
  work.<br>
  <br>
  One-time setup:<br>
  <ol>
    <li><a href=
    "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/developerstudio/downloads/index.html">
    Install Oracle Developer Studio tools</a>.&nbsp; I used version
    12.5, and only installed the tools rather than the complete
    IDE.&nbsp; This is to give you the C and C++ compilers ('cc'
    and 'CC'), which have command-line options required by
    wxWidgets but not supported by 'gcc'.</li>
    <li>Install the <a href="https://www.opencsw.org/">Open CSW
    system</a>, add /opt/csw/bin to your PATH, and /opt/csw/lib to
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH.</li>
    <li>Install wxWidgets via the Open CSW system.</li>
    <li>Install gtk2, tcl-8, tk-8, ncurses, freeglut, cmake, and
    gnu-grep using the Package Manager.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Build Virtual AGC:<br></p>
  <ol type="a"></ol>
  <ul>
    <li>In the Virtual AGC source directory (which for me was
    ~/git/virtualagc), run "gmake SOLARIS=yes install" or "gmake
    SOLARIS=yes clean install".&nbsp; (Note that 'sudo' is neither
    necessary nor desirable.)&nbsp; Note the use of 'gmake' (rather
    than just 'make').<br></li>
  </ul>This creates a Virtual AGC launcher (which is actually just
  a shell script) on the Desktop, and you can run Virtual AGC from
  that.&nbsp; If it asks you whether to "Run" or "Run in terminal",
  the proper choice is "Run".&nbsp; Unfortunately, no icon gets
  associated with the launcher, but you can optionally associate
  one by right-clicking on the launcher, selecting Properties, and
  using ~/VirtualAGC/Resources/ApolloPatch2-transparent.png as the
  image.<br>
  <br>
  You can "uninstall" by the deleting the desktop launcher,
  the&nbsp; ~/VirtualAGC folder, and the source-code directory you
  downloaded from GitHub.<br>

  This section relates to building Virtual AGC on Mac OS X Lion
  (10.7), with Xcode 4.6.3.&nbsp; The executive summary is that it
  works, and the simulation can be run, but the source code may not
  be browsable from within VirtualAGC.<br>
  <br>
  Note that both the Mac OS X and Xcode versions are both very far
  behind the times ... but they're the latest that can be installed
  on the newest Mac I have, and unless somebody wants to give me a
  newer one for free, that's the last Mac I'll ever have.&nbsp; So
  these instructions may or may not work on your Mac.&nbsp;
  Similarly, <a href=
  "https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/README.md">the
  README file at GitHub</a> may or may not contain useful
  information on building in newer versions of Mac OS X.&nbsp; Let
  me know if you have a better build procedure than I do.<br>
  <br>
  Setup:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Install <a href=
    "https://developer.apple.com/download/more">most-current
    version of Xcode for your version of Mac OS X</a> ... of
    course!<br></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.macports.org/">Install
    MacPorts</a>.</li>
    <li>Use MacPorts to install wxWidgets 2.8.12:&nbsp; "sudo port
    install wxgtk-2.8" or "sudo port install wxWidgets-2.8",
    depending on your Xcode version.</li>
    <li>Use MacPorts to install cmake:&nbsp; "sudo port install
    cmake".<br></li>
    <li>Install Allegro 4.4.2:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Use MacPorts:&nbsp; "sudo port install allegro".&nbsp;
      That doesn't work on some versions of Xcode, in which case
      instead use the next step.&nbsp; Be aware that Allegro
      version 5.x does not work for our purposes, so alternate
      installations like "sudo port install allegro5" aren't
      helpful.<br></li>
      <li>Install from source:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://liballeg.org/old.html">Download</a> and
        unpack the source code for version 4.4.2.</li>
        <li>"cd allegro-4.4.2"</li>
        <li>"mkdir Build"</li>
        <li>"cd Build"</li>
        <li>"cmake .."</li>
        <li>"make"</li>
        <li>"sudo make install"</li>
      </ul>
      <li>If <i>both</i> of the approaches above fail, as they did
      on my (obsolete) Mac, it's not a disaster, and you can still
      proceed.<br></li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <p>Building Virtual AGC:<br></p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>'cd' into Virtual AGC source directory, as obtained from
    GitHub.</li>
    <li>Determine where wxWidgets was installed by using the
    command "port contents wxgtk-2.8 | grep /bin/" (or "port
    contents wxWidgets-2.8 | grep /bin/").&nbsp; What you're
    actually trying to find out is the directory in which the
    program 'wx-config' is installed.&nbsp; In my case, I found
    that the location was
    /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/wxWidgets.framework/Versions/wxGTK/2.8/bin.&nbsp;
    You have to add that to your PATH, so that the 'wx-config'
    program can be found during the build.&nbsp; The command is
    "export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/.../bin".&nbsp; You can test that
    it worked with a command like "wx-config --list", from which we
    would like to see that the default configuration is
    "gtk2-unicode-release-2.8".&nbsp; By the way, unless you make
    this change to the PATH permanent (which is done in
    ~/.profile), the PATH will be reset back to the default one as
    soon as you close the command-line terminal you're using for
    this.</li>
    <li>Do "make MACOSX=yes install" or "make MACOSX=yes clean
    install".</li>
  </ol>The result is that a new app icon appears on the desktop,
  and you can launch Virtual AGC from that.<br>
  <ol type="a"></ol>
  <p>The process described above works, you can run the VirtualAGC
  program from the desktop icon, and you can run the various
  mission simulations from within VirtualAGC.&nbsp;<br></p>
  <p>However, at least on my now-relatively-primitive Mac, you
  cannot browse the AGC or AEA source code from within
  VirtualAGC.&nbsp; What is <i>supposed</i> to happen when you use
  VirtualAGC's source-browsing feature is that it simply launches
  whatever default web-browser you have set up on your system, and
  shows you the AGC/AEA source code within that browser ... and
  indeed, this approach <i>used to work</i> in Mac OS X.&nbsp; But
  what happens for me is that there's simply an error message
  complaining that "There is no default application configured for
  HTML files".&nbsp; However, I can certainly configure the default
  browser, and have changed it back and forth between Safari and
  Chrome, so I'm not sure what this message is complaining
  about.&nbsp; Perhaps it's an X11 error.&nbsp; At any rate, I have
  not been able to solve it.&nbsp; You can still browse the source,
  of course:&nbsp; simply right-click on the VirtualAGC app icon on
  the desktop, and select "show package contents"; navigate down to
  Contents/Resources/source/, select the mission you're interested
  in, and double-click on the MAIN.agc.html file you find in that
  directory.&nbsp; It will open up in your default browser, just as
  it <i>should</i> have done in the VirtualAGC program.<br></p>
  <p>Another quirk that may be of interest on the Mac is how to run
  individual GUI applications like yaDSKY2 or yaTelemetry, without
  having to run the VirtualAGC application.&nbsp; Again,
  right-click on the VirtualAGC desktop icon and select "show
  package contents".&nbsp; Navigate down to Contents/MacOS/, and
  you'll find the various individual GUI applications there, where
  you can simply run them by double-clicking on them.<br></p>

  This section relates to building Virtual AGC on 64-bit Windows 7,
  though the procedure doesn't seem to have anything in it that's
  specific to that version of Windows.&nbsp; (It's merely that I've
  only <i>tried</i> it on Windows 7.)&nbsp; The building process
  uses MinGW/Msys (as opposed to Visual Studio), and I don't know
  whether or not there is a valid Visual Studio build process.<br>
  <br>
  First-time setup of the Windows box is somewhat time-consuming
  (but building Virtual AGC is pretty easy after that):<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Install <a href="http://www.mingw.org">the <b>MinGW</b>
    compiler and the <b>Msys</b> Linux-like command-line
    development environment</a>, using the downloadable "MinGW
    Installation Manager".&nbsp; This installation program changes
    over time, so I cannot tell you precisely how to use it, and
    can only give you a general idea.&nbsp; Use the default choices
    for installation directory (c:\mingw) and other settings, if
    any are offered.&nbsp; Note that by default, the batch file
    c:\mingw\msys\1.0\msys.bat is what's used to start the
    <b>Msys</b> command shell as in the next step below, and you
    might want to manually create a desktop icon or a Windows
    start-menu entry for running that batch file.&nbsp; If you are
    unlucky enough to have a Windows user name containing spaces,
    you will encounter difficulties.&nbsp; The instructions at the
    www.mingw.org website explain what to do in that
    situation.&nbsp; Specific packages which you need to install
    using the MinGW Installation Manager, at least at this writing,
    which may not be among the defaults are:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>All of the packages in the "Basic Setup", except Ada,
      FORTRAN, and Objective-C compilers.</li>
      <li>Among the packages in "All Packages":<br></li>
      <ul>
        <li>"msys-libregex" (dev+dll)</li>
        <li>"msys-libncurses" (dev+dll)</li>
        <li>"msys-wget"</li>
        <li>"msys-unzip"</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Run <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span>, to bring
    up a command shell.&nbsp; <i>All</i> of the following steps
    occur within this command shell and not at a "DOS" command
    line.&nbsp; Some of the "DOS" commands you probably are
    familiar with (such as "dir") don't work in this shell, while
    Linux-type replacements ("ls -l") are used instead.&nbsp; Some
    commands, like "cd", work almost the same way, though there are
    subtle differences. Also, '/' is the separator for folders in
    path-names, rather than '\'.&nbsp; Google for "bash" if you're
    interested in these kinds of differences.&nbsp;<br></li>
    <li>Install the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL library,
    version 1.2</a>.&nbsp; You should find that there is a download
    file specifically labeled as a Win32 development library for
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">MinGW</span>.&nbsp; Within
    your <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> home
    directory, unpack the download file, 'cd' into the directory it
    creates.&nbsp; Do "mkdir /usr/local", and run the command "make
    install-sdl prefix=/usr/local".&nbsp; (The /usr directory
    within <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> will
    probably correspond to something like c:\mingw\msys\1.0\ in
    your Windows filesystem.) &nbsp; <span style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp; <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">All</span> software needed to build
    Virtual AGC will be installed under /usr/local, so eventually
    it will be populated with sub-directories such as
    /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib, and so
    on.&nbsp; The Virtual AGC makefiles are hard-coded to assume
    these installation locations.&nbsp; Note, however, that the
    Virtual AGC binaries you are going to create are <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">not</span> installed under /usr/local,
    because while the Virtual AGC apps are being created using
    <b>Msys</b>, <b>Msys</b> is not needed to run them ... they are
    simply Windows programs like any other.<br></li>
    <li>Obtain a source zipfile of <a href=
    "http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets, version 2.8.12</a>, or
    as close to this 2.8.x version as is available.&nbsp; Of the
    several varieties offered for download (wxAll, wxMSW, wxGTK,
    ...) chose wxMSW, and make sure you get the source code rather
    than an installer program.&nbsp; Unzip the downloaded file in
    your home directory, 'cd' into the directory this creates, and
    then do "./configure --enable-unicode", "make", and "make
    install".</li>
    <li>Though it has nothing to do with <i>building</i> Virtual
    AGC, if you want to have access to Stephen Hotto's contributed
    Lunar Module accessories when you <i>run</i> Virtual AGC,
    you'll also have to <a href=
    "https://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/">install
    Tcl/Tk</a>.&nbsp;<br></li>
  </ol>Once this one-time setup is complete, you should now be able
  to build Virtual AGC as follows.&nbsp; As above, all of the
  following steps take place in the <b>Msys</b> command shell, and
  <u>not</u> from a "DOS" command line:<br>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Get the Virtual AGC source code from GitHub (from the link
    at the top of this page), either by using 'git', if installed
    on your computer, or by downloading a zipfile and unzipping
    it.&nbsp; For the sake of discussion, I'm going to suppose that
    the folder you get from doing this is called "virtualagc" and
    is in your home directory.<br></li>
    <li>Do "cd virtualagc".<br></li>
    <li>Build it: "make WIN32=yes install" or "make WIN32=yes clean
    install".&nbsp;<br></li>
  </ol>This process creates a Desktop launcher for Virtual AGC
  (actually, it's just a batch file on your Desktop), and you can
  run Virtual AGC from that launcher.<br>
  <br>
  You can "uninstall" simply by removing the desktop icon and
  %HOMEPATH%\VirtualAGC, and whatever source-folder you downloaded
  from GitHub.<br>

  For development snapshot 20090802 and later, it's possible to
  build <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>—not the
  entire Virtual AGC suite, just <b>yaAGC</b>—from (I guess) a Mac,
  if you've downloaded an iPhone development kit.&nbsp; From the "I
  guess" in the preceding sentence, you'll probably be able to
  deduce that I'm just parrotting someone else's words and don't
  really know what I'm talking about ... and you'd be right.&nbsp;
  The instructions and mods necessary to do it came from Alberto
  Galdo (thanks, Alberto!).&nbsp; If you try it and it doesn't
  work, blame me for not implementing Alberto's instructions
  properly.&nbsp; We'll zero in on it eventually.<br>
  <br>
  To build, simply 'cd' into the yaAGC/yaAGC/ folder and do
  this:<br>
  <br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    make IPHONE=yes<br>
  </div><br>
  As for how useful <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
  by itself is, it's obviously only marginally useful until such
  time as there's a DSKY.&nbsp; You should be able to do
  command-line debugging, however, so you could in theory run and

  <ol>
    <li>Run the <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
    program, select "Validation suite" as the simulation type, and
    hit the "Run" button.</li>
    <li>A code of "00" will appear in the PROG area of the DSKY,
    and the OPR ERR lamp will flash.&nbsp; This means that the
    validation program is ready to start.<br></li>
    <li>Press the PRO key on the DSKY.&nbsp; The OPR ERR light will
    go off and the validation program will begin.<br></li>
    <li>There is no indication that the test is running.&nbsp; The
    test takes about 77 seconds.</li>
    <li>If all tests are passed, then the PROG area on the DSKY
    will show the code "77", and the OPR ERR lamp will flash.&nbsp;
    (The return code is 77 because 77 is the largest 2-digit octal
    number.&nbsp; It is just a coincidence that the test duration
    is also 77 seconds.)<br></li>
    <li>If some tests fail, an error code other than "00" or "77"
    will be displayed in the PROG area on the DSKY, and the OPR ERR
    lamp will flash.</li>
    <li>In the latter case, you can proceed from one test to the
    next by pressing the PRO key.&nbsp; The meanings of the error
    codes are determined by reading the file
    Validation/Validation.agc.</li>

  <h2><a name="Some_Resource_Issues_on_Slower" id=
  "Some_Resource_Issues_on_Slower"></a>Some Resource Issues on
  Slower Computers, Such as Raspberry Pi<br></h2>On new but slow
  computers like Raspberry Pi, or old computers such as
  PowerPC-based Macs, the CPU utilization for Virtual AGC can be
  rather high.&nbsp; Indeed if you ran every available option on an
  early-model Pi, you could find yourself using close to 100% of
  the CPU.&nbsp; For the default configuration of VirtualAGC (Lunar
  Module AGC with DSKY and Telemetry but without abort system or
  IMU), I find the following:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Pi B+:&nbsp; 80% CPU utilization.&nbsp;<br></li>
    <li>Pi 3: 40% CPU utilization.<br></li>
  </ul>
  <p>If that's too much for you, there are some things you may be
  able to do to make it more efficient.&nbsp; First, note that the
  VirtualAGC program — which isn't a component of the simulation,
  but merely a convenient graphical interface so that you don't
  have to memorize command-line options for the actual components —
  actually takes 25-30% of the CPU (for either of the two Pi models
  mentioned above) all by itself.&nbsp; You don't really need to
  run it if you don't want to.&nbsp; But how do you run a
  simulation easily without VirtualAGC?&nbsp; Well, if you run the
  simulation just <i>once</i> from VirtualAGC, and exit the
  simulation immediately after starting it, you'll find that it has
  automatically created a script called "simulate" which can be
  used to start that exact configuration of the simulation without
  running VirtualAGC itself.&nbsp; As a result, you get CPU
  utilizations closer to 50% or 10%, respectively, on the two Pi
  models mentioned above.&nbsp; To just run that script, you do
  this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <tt>cd VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/Resources</tt><tt><br></tt>
    <tt>./simulate</tt><br>
  </blockquote><br>
