Apollo 11 Launch

This core file contains the state of the AGC at about 4 hours before launch during the Apollo 11 mission. The AGC has been configured with the pad load for Apollo 11, the numbers loaded into the erasable memory of the AGC on the launchpad. These were developed for "Project Apollo - NASSP" in the Orbiter Space Flight Simulator. There are a few adaptions that had to be done for Orbiter. The rotational axis of Earth in Orbiter doesn't have nutation, the simulated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) doesn't need drift comensation etc. But all in all this core file will be very close to the state of the Apollo 11 CM AGC on the pad.
