    <h1>A Unique Time-Limited Opportunity to Help</h1>
    <h2>Scan, Baby, Scan!<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Most of this web-page covers things you can do to help in a very
      general way, but it so happens that <i>right now</i> there is a
      very specific way in which we'd like to get your help.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Right now, a very large (by our standards) set of very rare
      AGC-related material has become available to us from the personal
      keepsakes of Hugh Blair-Smith and Don Eyles, who were among the
      original developers of the AGC.&nbsp; Some of you may recall Don
      Eyles as the hero programmer of Apollo 14.&nbsp; That story has
      been told and retold many places on the web, so I won't repeat it
      here, but for example, there's <a
href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/extra-weird-looking-freak-saves-apollo-14-19710318">a
        Rolling Stone article about it</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To acquire this material and present it here online, however, it
      must be scanned, and scanning costs money, and that's where we'd
      like your help.<br>
    </p>
    <p>No, don't send us money, please!&nbsp; The materials will be
      scanned by <a href="http://www.archive.org">archive.org</a>, and
      anybody who is kind enough to help out will be billed directly by
      archive.org after the scanning takes place.<br>
    </p>
    <p>What we are looking for, for each one of the documents we need to
      scan, is a "sponsor" who will commit to paying for that
      scanning.&nbsp; So what we'd like for you to do is to choose which
      particular document you'd like to sponsor, from the list in the
      next section, and to drop me an email (Ron Burkey
      &lt;info@sandroid.org&gt;) with your name, physical address, and
      telephone number.&nbsp; If two or more people want the same
      document, the first email I receive wins it, so if you have a
      second choice, include that in the email.&nbsp; I'll fill out the
      paperwork for archive.org, and we'll keep you apprised of the
      progress.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The amount you can expect to pay is $3 plus $0.25/page, so the
      list in the next section includes page counts to help you figure
      out the total.&nbsp; If you are not in the U.S., that is fine with
      archive.org as long as your email address is valid.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>The Document List</h2>
    <p>Here's the list of documents we are trying to acquire.&nbsp;
      You'll notice that some of them already have sponsors, and indeed,
      some of them have already been scanned.&nbsp; Don't choose one of
      those.&nbsp; Incidentally, after the documents are scanned,
      archive.org will continue to host them online at quite a high
      resolution, and you can examine <a
        href="http://archive.org/details/virtualagcproject">our Virtual
        AGC "collection" of documents at archive.org</a> to better
      understand what you're helping to accomplish.<br>

            This is, in principle, something we've already had for many
            years, and is already online many places on the web,
            including at this site.&nbsp; However, the version which has
            been available these many years was <i>digitally mutilated
              by an OCR process</i> and the original high-quality scans
            discarded.&nbsp; Consequently, the available scans are
            barely readable.&nbsp; This would be a new, clean,
            unmutilated scan.&nbsp; A similar thing happened with the
            Colossus 249 (Apollo 9 Command Module) scans that have been
            available in mutilated form for many years:&nbsp; they were
            eventually replaced by a clean, legible scan.<br>

            "ZERLINA was my personal non-flight testbed for developing
            new capabilities, some of which later moved to the main line
            LUMINARY. Its main feature was a new version of the Servicer
            job in which the guidance period was allowed to stretch
            beyond the nominal 2 seconds â€” part of the overall effort in
            response to the CPU overload on 11. Variable Servicer would
            have been necessary if new capability was required that
            would have further reduced our CPU margin, such as something
            called P66 LPD, also implemented in ZERLINA, based on an
            idea of John Young's, that would have facilitated making
            very accurate landings. This capability is described in
            Draper Lab report E-2581, which I can at some point make
            available. Neither Variable Servicer nor P66 LPD was ever
            approved for LUMINARY. Things developed first in ZERLINA
            that DID make the jump to LUMINARY included the a priori
            terrain model (needed to land in more mountainous terrain),
            and also a new version of the "landing analog displays," the
            same mentioned in the Tindallgram of July 24, 1970. In my
            view ZERLINA 56 still represents the state of the art for
            manned landings on the Moon."&nbsp; Paul Fjeld has also told
            me, although Don doesn't mention it, that John Young also
            worked with this in the LM simulator.<br>

          "They consist of two parts, the sim itself, and an "edit" of
          raw data dumped during the sim onto a MARSROT tape. The sim
          part consists of some pages of initialization data, then the
          run itself. The printout includes astronaut inputs, DSKY
          displays, lines called "clocks" that are printed when the code
          passes through certain locations, and for every two seconds of
          simulated time a three-line summary of data from the
          simulation environment including the current position,
          velocity, attitude, etc., etc. The edit portion includes
          additional sim and AGC data, also printed at two-second

    <h2>What's In It For Me?</h2>
    <p>Well, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you did a good
      thing, and your name will be permanently enshrined as a sponsor
      (assuming you want it to be so enshrined) both at this website,
      and in our archive.org collection!<br>
    </p>
    <p>Not enough for you?&nbsp; Well, to express my thanks, if you
      sponsor the scanning of one of these documents, I'll personally
      buy you a thank-you gift, as follows:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sponsor a document of 100 or more pages:&nbsp; you get an
        Apollo coffee mug.</li>
      <li>Sponsor a document of 500 or more pages:&nbsp; you get an
        Apollo ball cap.</li>
      <li>Sponsor a document of 1000 or more pages:&nbsp; you get an
        Apollo tee shirt.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And so as to be fair, if you sponsor multiple smaller documents,
      you can add the pages counts together to go to the next higher
      gift category, if you like.&nbsp; Or if you offered to sponsor a
      larger document and it had become unavailable so that you had to
      accept your second choice, which was smaller, it was your original
      good intention that determines your gift category.&nbsp; Of
      course, you can optionally choose a lower gift category, or no
      gift at all (that works for me!).<br>
    </p>
    <p>After the scans are complete, and you've paid archive.org, I'll
      get you the exact details and get your choices (style, size,
      color, etc.), but you'll have a choice of some reasonable
      variation of the following:<br>

    <h1><a name="Information"></a>Information</h1>
    First and foremost, Virtual AGC is about providing AGC/AGS related
    documentation that cannot (or at least, previously could not) be
    found elsewhere online.&nbsp; Examples of items that will always be
    in demand are these:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Legible scans or page-by-page digital photographs of <span
          style="font-style: italic;">assembly listings </span>for any
        Apollo software versions not already on this site.&nbsp; These
        do not have to be listings from actual missions, and could be
        intermediate versions.&nbsp; By an "assembly listing", I mean a
        printout showing assembly-language source code and the binary to
        which that source code reduces upon assembly.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Scans of any original Apollo documents not already available <a
          href="links.html">here at Virtual AGC</a> or elsewhere. &nbsp;
        Of particular value would be software patches applied at
        runtime, software problems reports, mission checklists, and
        detailed technical documentation of hardware interfaced to the
        AGC.&nbsp; <a href="QuestForInfo.html">Click here for hints of
          where to find such documentation</a>.</li>
      <li>Or even <span style="font-style: italic;">information</span>
        about where such material resides, such as "Museum XYZ has a
        listing of Luminary 1D".<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    If you have such material, you'll probably want to contact me
    directly to determine that we don't already have that item in
    process, to discuss methods of preparation, to discuss means of
    delivery to me, etc.&nbsp; A pretty complete description of all the
    available options is available on our <a href="HowToDigitize.html">"how


















      to digitize" page</a>, so you'll probably want to at least skim
    that page.&nbsp; When you contact me, a page or two of scanned
    images (including the title page) attached to the email might be
    useful.<br>
    <br>
    <h1><a name="Wiki"></a>Wiki</h1>
    If you have AGC/AGS information other than original Apollo documents
    you'd like to make publicly available, you could do so by contacting
    me directly.&nbsp; But in some cases you may find a better and more
    straightforward approach may be to <a
      href="https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc/wiki">contribute
      your knowledge to the wiki</a>.&nbsp; Examples of things that are
    useful are theoretical discussions, historical information or
    anecdotes, tutorials on how to perform certain tasks with the AGC or
    AGS, etc.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <h1><a name="Coding"></a>Coding</h1>
    If you have a simple bug-fix, it might be easiest to submit a patch
    directly to me.&nbsp; Please be sure to tell me when you do so which
    development snapshot or which subversion revision you started from.<br>
    <br>
    For more extensive coding, we have a <a
      href="https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc">code repository
      at GitHub</a> and if you have ideas for new features then you can
    contribute them to the project via the repository.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Some particular sore spots which could be addressed by an ambitious
    coder include:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
        program so that it can interpret downlink telemetry streams
        emitted from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
        program in order to update LM state vectors.</li>
      <li>Fixing <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> so that
        its downlink telemetry streams work.</li>
      <li>Fixing <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span>
        (or providing a supplemental program) to display <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> downlink telemetry.</li>
      <li>Adding an IMU simulation program.</li>
      <li>Adding an FDAI simulation program.</li>
      <li>Adding an AOT simulation program.</li>
      <li>Working out the details of using the hand-controller
        simulations (<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>, <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>, <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>) and/or IMU in the
        Command Module.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Adding simulated peripheral devices for the AGS.</li>
      <li>Addition of more control-panel visual realism.&nbsp; (For
        example, control panels that look like control panels, with
        switches that look like switches, in proper locations, rather
        switches that look like GUI push-button widgets, located
        wherever is convenient.)</li>
      <li>Integrating Virtual AGC into an existing open-source
        spacecraft simulator program.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    While the excellent <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>
    contributed program by Stephan Hotto already provides a simulated
    IMU and FDAI, it has a couple of drawbacks in that it is written in
    the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span> interpreted
    language, and that it is closely tailored to the LM (making it only
    of limited value for the CM).&nbsp; The fact that it is in <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span> makes it relatively slow,
    and almost unusable on slower computers.&nbsp; Of course, as time
    goes on and computers become faster and faster, this becomes less of
    a concern.&nbsp; The unusability with the CM will remain a
    concern.&nbsp; One possibility is to simply update <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> itself.&nbsp;
    Another is to convert it to C/C++.&nbsp; Still another is to replace
    it with IMU/FDAI workalikes.&nbsp; Any such effort, other than the
    latter, would preferably be coordinated with Stephan rather than
    being done unilaterally without his knowledge.<br>
    <br>
    More generally, while we will likely accept any useful code that is
    supplied, you should keep the following suggested guidelines in
    mind:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>All programs are cross-platform, with the minimum acceptable
        list of supported platforms being Linux, Windows XP, and Mac OS
        X 10.4 (and later).</li>
      <li>Only open-source development tools are used.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Non-GUI programs are preferentially written in C.</li>
      <li>GUI programs are preferentially created using the <a
          href="http://www.wxwidgets.org"><span style="font-weight:
            bold;">wxWidgets</span></a> toolkit, in the C++ language.</li>
      <li>The compilers used are <span style="font-weight: bold;">gcc</span>
        and <span style="font-weight: bold;">g++</span> (or <a
          href="http://www.mingw.org"><span style="font-weight: bold;">MinGW</span></a>
        in Windows).<br>
      </li>
      <li>The code-formatting style used is the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Formatting.html#Formatting">GNU



















          style</a>.&nbsp; This doesn't necessarily mean you have to
        change all of your coding habits, as there is a handy program
        called <span style="font-weight: bold;">indent</span> readily
        available on most Linux systems and Mac OS X that will reformat
        C/C++ source files into this style.&nbsp; It is also <a
          href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/indent.htm">available
for



















          Windows</a>.</li>
      <li>Primary code development is done in Linux, which means that
        UNIX-style line endings ("\n") are used in preference to Windows
        line endings ("\r\n") or Mac endings ("\r").&nbsp; While this is
        not a problem for <span style="font-weight: bold;">gcc</span>,
        it may be a problem for your source-code editing software.</li>
      <li>You retain the copyright for the code you write, but you are
        expected to license it under the terms of the GNU GPL version
        2.&nbsp; The license text within the source files should quote
        the license as "GPL version 2 or later".</li>
    </ol>
    It should be noted that making choices other than these is likely to
    make inclusion of your code into Virtual AGC binary installer
    packages impractical, and that such omission is likely to greatly
    reduce the number of people actually using your code.<br>

    <h1><a name="Cash"></a>Cash</h1>
    Virtual AGC is a non-commercial project in the public interest and

    This is an area where no technical expertise is required for
    participation, particularly in proofing.<br>
    <br>
    A situation arises from time-to-time in which AGC assembly-listings
    have been received and require conversion to machine-readable form
    for integration into Virtual AGC.&nbsp; Such conversion tasks are
    quite dreary and time-consuming, and therefore are very wearying
    when done by a single individual.&nbsp; On the other hand, there is
    a certain pleasure involved in participating in such a conversion,
    because you can know that you are helping to make available for
    actual use code which has not seen the light of day for 40

    Hey, the list is empty, so you'll just have to wait until we have
    some more stuff in the hopper!<br>
    <br>
    Code conversion is a process wherein we take the scanned or
    photographed images of a hardcopy listing of an AGC&nbsp; program,
    and convert it to source code (text files) that can be processed to
    created the executable software which runs on the simulated AGC
    CPU.&nbsp; It is not necessary to understand AGC assembly language,
    or any computer language, to do this; but if you are somewhat
    familiar already with the AGC programs, you will be awarded with
    some small thrills along the way.<br>
    <br>
    Here is a basic outline of the conversion process:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Contact me to receive an assignment.&nbsp; The AGC source code
        is divided into a sequence of well-defined modules, with names
        such as INTERPRETER or IMU MODE SWITCHING ROUTINES, and you'll
        be given a list of one or more modules to convert.</li>
      <li>The AGC code does not change much from mission to mission, or
        from spacecraft to spacecraft.&nbsp; (For example, the software
        for Apollo 11 is likely to be similar to the software for Apollo
        13, and the software for the CM is likely to be similar in many
        respects to the software for the LM.)&nbsp; Therefore, the
        appropriate conversion technique is to start from <span
          style="font-style: italic;">existing</span> source code from a
        different mission or spacecraft, and then to simply make
        whatever changes are needed.&nbsp; You will therefore first need
        to obtain that existing source code by installing Virtual AGC on
        your computer via the appropriate binary installer program, or
        from the development snapshot, or from the <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">subversion</span> repository.&nbsp;
        I'll instruct you as to the likeliest close mission/spacecraft
        matches in the instructions I send you.</li>
      <li><a href="http://ibiblio.org/apollo/ScansForConversion">Download







          or examine online the appropriate scans of the assembly
          listings</a> being converted.&nbsp; (I'd recommend looking at
        them online on an as-needed basis, but you're free to do it
        however you like.)<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Copy the appropriate starting source-code files into a new,
        clean folder, retaining the names of the files unchanged.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Edit the file header to provide correct information (such as
        mission number, module name, your name, the date, etc.).&nbsp;
        (See picture below.)&nbsp; In the instructions I send you, I
        will give you a template file-header that can be used.&nbsp; <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:&nbsp; Source code is
        7-bit ASCII only!&nbsp; If you use a Unicode-enabled editor, you
        will produce something that looks fine, but which will be a big
        mess for me to use, since I will have to seek out and destroy
        all of the Unicode characters you had added.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Compare the source file line-by-line against the scanned file,
        making changes where necessary.&nbsp; Note certain differences
        between the scans and the textual source-code files (referring
        to the picture below):<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>In the scans, "comments" begin with a special character such
          as 'R' or 'P' in the first column, or simply appear on the
          right-hand side of the page, following the actual code without
          any special marking to distinguish them.&nbsp; In the Virtual
          AGC source-code files, however, they should be preceded by the
          '#' character.</li>
        <li>In the scans, each line begins with several columns that are
          not part of the source-code itself and are instead produced by
          the action of converting the source code to binary executable
          code.&nbsp; These columns are <span style="font-style:
            italic;">omitted</span> in the source-code files being
          created.</li>
        <li>Each line of source code begins with an optional location
          label of up to 8 characters in length, followed by an optional
          machine-language "opcode", followed by one or two optional
          parameters, followed by optional "comments".&nbsp; In the
          source-code files being created, we prefer to have tab-stops
          that are 8-spaces wide, and for the optional label to begin at
          the left-hand margin, the opcode to begin at the 2nd tab stop
          (i.e., 16 spaces in), and for each of the other fields to
          begin at the next succeeding tab stop.&nbsp; It doesn't really
          matter where comments are aligned, except that it's nice if
          they all line up at the same tab stop within any given file.</li>
        <li>Each time you move from one scanned page to the next, put in
          a comment giving the page number (from the upper right-hand
          corner of the scan), such as "# Page 292".&nbsp; This helps
          you or other people when finding or fixing errors.</li>
        <li>We use all upper-case text for the labels, source-code, and
          AGC program comments, to duplicate the whole AGC developer
          "experience".&nbsp; Comments you add to the code yourself
          should be lower-case or mixed upper/lower case to distinguish
          them, and you might want to mark them with the date or
          something so that we know they weren't part of the original
          code.&nbsp; You should add comments for any unusual condition,
          such as missing or garbled code.</li>
        <li>Presumably because of limitations of the character sets
          originally used, you may find that the assembly listings have
          used some character substitutions like "-" for
          apostrophes.&nbsp; Wisely or unwisely, I chose to reverse
          these substitutions.&nbsp; I'd suggest that for consistency
          you continue the trend.<br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">When to raise your hand and
            ask for help</span>:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Tell me if you can't read some code or program
            comments.&nbsp; (Though note that zooming in or zooming out
            may help.)&nbsp; I may have higher-resolution images which
            can be consulted than those posted online.</li>
          <li>Tell me if you encounter pages which are cropped so badly
            or with such poor contrast or brightness that you think they
            are unacceptable.&nbsp; Again, I may have better images
            available.</li>
          <li>Tell me, but do not panic, if you find small sections of
            code which are missing or garbled, as this is almost always
            a situation for which workarounds exist.</li>
          <li>If you think you have detected errors in the source-code
            files you <span style="font-style: italic;">started</span>
            from, let me know (with some precision, please) what the
            error was and where it was located.&nbsp; This is a great
            opportunity to fix errorsâ€”in program comments,
            naturallyâ€”that may have been lurking unnoticed for
            years.&nbsp; Common errors are replacing 'O' with 'C', 'O'
            with 'D', 'O' with '0', 'F' with 'E' or 'P', 'P' with 'R',
            '2' with 'Z', and so forth.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Email the new source files you've created directly to
        me.&nbsp; If you have been assigned several, email them to me as
        you finish them.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    In the following pictures, some of the points mentioned in items #5
    and #6 above are illustrated using the first page of the SERVICER
    module of AGC program Luminary 131.&nbsp; (It is perhaps worth
    pointing out that according to the scan, this is page 852, while
    according to the converted source-code file it is page 857.&nbsp;
    This is because the Luminary 131 page images were originally
    supplied as a PDF file in which the page numbering within the PDF
    file did not exactly match the markings on the pages
    themselves.&nbsp; I hope to avoid this kind of discrepancy in future
    conversions.)<br>

    Finally, I'd offer the following counter-intuitive
    observation:&nbsp; Make every effort to eliminate error, but take
    comfort in the fact that I have means of detecting and correcting
    programming errors, and thus you don't need to worry too much about
    them.&nbsp; However, there is no method other than proof-reading to
    detect errors in program comments, so please take special care with
    those.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">In


















      other words, it is more important that you get program comments
      right than that you get the program code itself right.</span><br>

    <br>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    In addition to converting source code and comments from AGC program
    listings into source-code files, it is necessary for quality-control
    purposes to convert the executable code (which appears in the page
    images as 144 pages of octal numbers near the end of the page
    images) into a machine-readable text file as well.&nbsp; The
    accuracy of this conversion is extremely important.&nbsp; You see,
    the AGC source code is debugged only to the point at which the
    executable code that can be created from it matches the "octal
    listing" from these 144 pages ... so the AGC source code conversion
    can only be as good as the octal listing conversion.&nbsp; If the
    octal listing has conversion errors in it, then the source code is
    assured to have conversion errors as well.<br>
    <br>
    The "octal listing" files so created are given names such as
    Luminary131.binsource or Colossus249.binsource, and are provided in
    a Virtual AGC download along with the AGC source-code files.&nbsp;
    These days, it is no longer necessary to manually create these
    files, so no volunteer help is needed for binsource creation.&nbsp;
    However, regardless of the method used to create the binsource
    files, the files are just as prone to error as the source files, and
    therefore just as in need of volunteer assistance for
    proofing.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Those who are attuned to issues of this kind will recognize that the
    danger here is not <span style="font-style: italic;">error</span>
    as such, but rather the possibility that errors in binsource and
    source may <span style="font-style: italic;">match</span>.&nbsp;
    Therefore, one may naturally wonder how likely it is that the
    binsource file and the source-code files will just happen to have
    identical errors at corresponding memory locations?&nbsp; In other
    words, is there really much chance of there being undetected
    errors?&nbsp; The answer is that it depends on the method to create
    the binsource files.&nbsp; Under the present time-saving methods
    being used, it is <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight:
      bold;">very likely</span> that errors will coincide, and therefore
    it is very important for proofing to be done.&nbsp; Another logical
    question is this: given that each memory bankâ€”each 4-page block of
    the 144 pagesâ€”has an associated checksum, how likely is it that a
    bank with a correct checksum will still have undetected errors in
    it?&nbsp; The answer is that it is not likely for any given memory
    bank, but that in the past several cases have been encountered where
    banks with correct checksums have been found to have two or even
    three undetected errors in them that canceled out when the checksum
    was created.&nbsp; In other words, the bank checksums can make us
    feel better about the odds the conversion has been accurate, but
    only up to a certain point.&nbsp; So again, the quality of the code
    conversion can only be insured by having very good proofing of the
    octal listings in the binsource files.<br>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    Here are the procedures for helping out with the proofing of an
    octal listing:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>You don't really need an assignment from meâ€”in other words,
        you can simply start proofing something without consulting with
        meâ€”but it may be helpful if you send me a list of binsource
        files and page ranges you'd like to work on so that I can warn
        other people to work on different page ranges.</li>
      <li>On a page by page basis, compare a memory page from the <a
          href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ScansForConversion/">AGC
          page images</a> to a corresponding page in a binsource
        file.&nbsp; The binsource files are provided in the same folders
        as AGC source code when you download or install Virtual AGC.</li>
      <li>You do not need to edit the binsource files.&nbsp; Rather, you
        merely need to take notes of what you're doing.<br>
      </li>
      <li>For each page you complete proofing, <span style="font-style:
          italic; font-weight: bold;">inform me</span> of the
        following.&nbsp; (See the explanations following this procedure
        to understand what some of the things being asked for are.)<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>The binsource file being proofed (Luminary131.binsource,
          Comanche055.binsource, etc.)</li>
        <li>The page number that was proofed.</li>
        <li>The number of errors found on that page, <span
            style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">even if it is
            zero</span>.</li>
        <li>The memory locations of those errors.</li>
        <li>The proofing method used.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>The data being compared</h3>
    Below, you see examples of corresponding areas of the octal listing
    from an AGC page image and a binsource file (click to enlarge

                131 p. 1642</span></small><br>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    As you can see, the page image has various things in it that are
    simply ignored in the binsource file.&nbsp; For one, there is header
    info at the top of the page which is all discarded except that the
    binsource file has a comment giving the page number.&nbsp; (In
    binsource files, comments are prefixed with a semi-colon.)&nbsp;
    Each line in the page image is prefixed with a column that gives the
    memory address of the data, and this column is not put into the
    binsource file.&nbsp; Instead, the address from the first line on
    the page is placed in the page-number comment.&nbsp; You'll also
    notice notations like "C:" or "I:" interspersed throughout the data,
    and that these are discarded.&nbsp; (They indicate that the memory
    address is a Constant or Interpretive data, and were in the original
    program listing only for informational purposes anyway.)&nbsp;
    Finally, note that the contents of each memory location is a 5-digit
    octal number, but that in the page image it is a 5-digit octal
    number followed by a single digit of 0 or 1.&nbsp; This extra number
    is a <span style="font-style: italic;">parity bit</span>, and is of
    no value to us so we ignore it.<br>
    <br>
    Conversely, the binsource file has a couple of things in it that the
    page image does not.&nbsp; One thing that you cannot see in the
    example is that at the beginning of each 4-page block we place a
    notation that reads "BANK=<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>",


















    where <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> is the memory-bank
    number.&nbsp; In our example, this would have been on Page 1640, and
    would have been an extra line reading "BANK=15".&nbsp; One thing you
    can see in the screenshot above, however, is the notation ", A" in
    the page-number comment.&nbsp; We'll discuss this a little later.<br>
    <br>
    As far as the methods for comparing the page image with the
    binsource file are concerned, I think that many people's first
    inclinationâ€”mine included!â€”is to print out one or the other and put
    them side by side.&nbsp; I'd offer the observation that this method
    is essentially useless, and you will very likely give up after
    trying a page or two.&nbsp; I have hit upon a couple of methods that
    seem far superior to me in the sense that they are far less
    exhausting and detect many more errors than the side-by-side
    comparison method.<br>
    <h3>Audio/visual proofing</h3>
    If your computer is equipped with text-to-speech capability, you can
    do the following:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>View the appropriate page image on the screen.</li>
      <li>Use text-to-speech to cause the computer to speak aloud the
        corresponding page from the binsource file.</li>
      <li>Follow the page image with your eyes while the computer
        speaks.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    This method is the least-tiring method as far as I'm
    concerned.&nbsp; It produces the least eyestrain, and allows you to
    view the page images at any size you like.&nbsp; However, it has the
    drawback that most text-to-speech systems will try to pronounce
    something like 12345 as "twelve thousand three hundred forty five"
    and something like 00006 as "six", which can cause the playback
    speed to vary greatly from number to number, and takes a while to
    become familiar with.<br>
    <h3>Visual proofing</h3>
    In this method, you view the page image and the corresponding page
    from the binsource file at the same time, but you perform some
    tricks to make the comparison easy.&nbsp; What you do is to:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Adjust the zoom of the page image so that the vertical spacing
        of the text rows is exactly the same as the row spacing of the
        binsource file in a text editor program.&nbsp; (This is
        super-easy if you view the page image online with the Mozilla
        Firefox browser.&nbsp; All you have to do is to adjust the
        Firefox window size.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>You make the text-editor window in which you're viewing the
        binsource file really narrow so that only a single 5-digit
        column (or perhaps a little more) is visible.</li>
      <li>You drag the text editor so that the columns being compared
        are side-by-side.</li>
    </ul>
    For example (click to enlarge):<br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="VisualCompare.jpg"><img
          alt="&quot;Visual compare&quot; of page image to binsource"
          title="Click to enlarge" src="VisualCompare-small.jpg"
          style="border: 2px solid ; width: 621px; height: 478px;"
          height="478" width="621"></a><br>
      <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
        On newer sets of AGC page images, in which superior digitizing
        techniques are used, the ease of use of this method is even more
        striking.<br>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Proof markings</h3>
    Every time a given memory page is proofed an extra field like one of
    the following is added to the page-number comment:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>"V" means that the page was visually proofed and that no
        errors were found.</li>
      <li>"V(<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>)" means that the
        page was visually proofed and that <span style="font-style:
          italic;">n</span> errors were found.</li>
      <li>"A" and "A(<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>)" are
        the same, except that the proofing was an audio/visual proofing
        rather than a visual proofing.</li>
      <li>"FV", "FV(<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>)", "FA",
        and "FA(<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>)" are the
        same except that it indicates a "final" proofing done after the
        bank checksum is already correct and thus when we're not really
        expecting to find any errors.</li>
    </ul>
    I actually add these notations myself, so you don't have to worry
    about them other than as guides to which memory pages are worth
    proofing.&nbsp; A page with a notation like "V(15), V(5), A(1), V,
    FV", for example, has already been proofed 5 time, including a final
    proofing, and the last two passes haven't found any errors ... so
    there's not an urgent need to proof it again.&nbsp; On the other
    hand, a page with <span style="font-style: italic;">no</span>
    proofing marks, or with a mark like "V(15)" is in urgent need of
    more proofing.<br>
    <br>
    Perhaps you will invent some wacky new method of proofing that works
    even better.&nbsp; If so, let me know about it and we'll invent a
    new notation for it.<br>

    After the code-conversion activities described in the preceding
    sections, we have a reasonable assurance that the program code is
    100% correctâ€”i.e., that the AGC program will execute properly unless
    there is a bug in the AGC CPU simulator itself.&nbsp; However, we
    also have good reason to believe from past experience that the
    program comments still have many errors.&nbsp; Normally, computer
    programmers treat program comments as an afterthought, and don't
    worry too much about them as long as the code itself is
    correct.&nbsp; But when trying to understand very old code such as
    the AGC programs, the program comments are very important.<br>
    <h3>Normal Procedure<br>
    </h3>
    If you want to help in proofing comments in existing source files,
    here are the instructions for doing so, assuming you have already
    installed Virtual AGC on your computer and therefore have all of the
    existing AGC source code available to you:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>You don't need any special assignment from me.&nbsp; I have no
        better idea as to where there may be bugs in program comments
        than you; they could be anywhere, in any source file; nor is
        there any team working on this problem in a fashion that needs
        coordination.&nbsp; However, the more times that a source file
        has been proofed, the less likely that you'll find errors in
        it.&nbsp; So simply choose an AGC source file whose modification
        history (in the header of the file) doesn't indicate that it has
        already had its comments proofed, or has been proofed less than
        other source files.<br>
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ScansForConversion">Download







          or examine online the assembly listing</a> for the same AGC
        spacecraft/mission/version.&nbsp; (I'd recommend looking at it
        online, but you're free to do it however you like.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Edit the file header "mod history" to show that you are
        comment-proofing the file.&nbsp; (See the pictures in the
        code-conversion section above.)&nbsp; <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">Note</span>:&nbsp; Source code is 7-bit ASCII
        only!&nbsp; If you use a Unicode-enabled editor, you will
        produce something that looks fine, but which will be a big mess
        for me to use, since I will have to seek out and destroy all of
        the Unicode characters you have inadvertantly added.&nbsp; This
        has proven to be a particular problem when people use
        Macs.&nbsp; If&nbsp; you are using a Mac and you are not certain
        that you can completely disable Unicode editing, it is perhaps
        best if you don't participate in this particular activity. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Compare the source file line-by-line against the scanned file,
        making changes where necessary.&nbsp; Step #6 in the
        "code-conversion" section above gives a lot of hints as to how
        to do this effectively.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important note</span>:&nbsp;
        If you find a comments which needs to be corrected, it is very
        likely that the same mistake exists in source-code files for
        other spacecraft or other missions.&nbsp; For example, suppose
        you are working on proofing INTERPRETER.s for Luminary131.&nbsp;
        There is also an INTERPRETER.s for Luminary099, Colossus249,
        Comanche055, etc.&nbsp; So if you correct all of these files,
        then you are <span style="font-style: italic;">multiplying the
          effectiveness</span> of the proofing you are doing.&nbsp; But
        remember that the comments may <span style="font-style:
          italic;">actually</span> have changed in the page images, so
        you can't blindly assume that a fix is necessarily applicable to
        a different AGC version unless you examine the page images for
        that AGC version as well.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Email the new source files you've created directly to me.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Advanced Technique</h3>
    If you have the appropriate software to do so, there is a quick
    technique by which comment fixes that have been made in the past for
    one type of spacecraft or mission can be ported to the source code
    for other spacecraft or missions.&nbsp; This is so because of the
    way the source-code files have been created.&nbsp; We started with
    the source code for one mission, then modified it (via the "code
    conversion" technique described earlier) for another mission, then
    modified those files for still other missions.&nbsp; Each time the
    code was modified, some comment-fixes may have been made, but
    probably were not back-ported to earlier source-code files.&nbsp; So
    if we <span style="font-style: italic;">compare</span> the
    corresponding source code for different missions, we can easily
    pinpoint where some corrections can be made.&nbsp; While this
    doesn't find all of the broken comments, it can help to find a lot
    of them with reduced effort by leveraging work that others have
    already done.<br>
    <br>
    In terms of the way we have created the source filesâ€”as opposed to
    the software evolution of the original Apollo Program's AGC
    developmentâ€”the ancestry of the source files is as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Luminary131 â†’ Colossus249 â†’
      Comanche055<br>
      Luminary131 â†’ Luminary099<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    So we would expect to see more comment fixes in Comanche055
    (relative to Luminary131) than we would in Colossus249.<br>
    <br>
    Fortunately, there are automated techniques for locating such
    differences, but you need the appropriate software to do so.&nbsp;
    On Linux, I use a (free) tool called <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">kompare</span> for this, but <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_comparison_tools">there
are



















      any number of such tools for different computer platforms</a> that
    may be suitable.&nbsp; Similar programs which can be had for free on
    Windows and Mac OS X are <span style="font-weight: bold;">WinMerge</span>
    and <span style="font-weight: bold;">FileMerge</span>,
    respectively.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
      style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&nbsp; I'll simply illustrate
    the technique using <span style="font-weight: bold;">kompare</span>.&nbsp;


















    If I run kompare on Luminary099/INTERPRETER.s and
    Luminary131/INTERPRETER.s (as of 2009-06-20), an excerpt of the
    comparison is seen below.&nbsp; (Click to enlarge if it's hard to
    read.)&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><a
        href="CommentProofWithKompare.jpg"><img alt="" title="Click to
          enlarge" src="CommentProofWithKompare-small.jpg"
          style="border: 2px solid ; width: 787px; height: 575px;"
          height="575" width="787"></a><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    A number of differences are immediately apparent:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>At lines 189 and 193 (using the numbers from the left-hand
        pane), we see page number differences.&nbsp; These are perfectly
        appropropriate since the code does appear on different pages in
        these two versions of the AGC code.</li>
      <li>At lines 182, 220, and 224, we see some code (rather than
        comment) differences, but actually, this is a case in which the
        change might be profitably ported over from one file to the
        other.&nbsp; The difference is that a space has been changed to
        a tab, and while this difference is unimportant to the software
        that processes the source code, the use of the tab instead of
        the space means that the fields line up better according to the
        preferred code-formatting described in step #6 of the "code
        conversion" section above.</li>
      <li>Finally, at line 195 we seen actual fix to a program comment,
        namely that the word "ARTGHMETIC" has been corrected to
        "ARITHMETIC".<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1><a name="Source-Code_Annotation"></a>Source-Code Annotation</h1>
    For those who are interested in providing help that requires a much
    greater involvement in understanding the technical aspects of
    AGC/AGS source code, such as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
    program, there is an interest in having an on-going program of
    providing modern annotations to the AGC/AGS source code.&nbsp; Such
    modern annotations can provide assistance to others examining the
    code, and can therefore be viewed as an educational service.&nbsp;
    Annotating the source code can help the student in several ways:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>It can provide entertaining background information.&nbsp; For
        example, in the source code which produces 1201/1202 alarms,
        background information about the 1201/1202 alarms during the
        Apollo 11 landing can be added.<br>
      </li>
      <li>It can supplement the sometimes sketchy program comments
        provided by the original developers.&nbsp; They say that you
        never really understand a subject until you can teach it to
        others.&nbsp; Well, here's your chance!<br>
      </li>
      <li>It can list or hyperlink helpful relevant resource
        materials.&nbsp; For example, INTERPRETER.s could have a
        hyperlink to the manuals describing AGC interpreter language.</li>
      <li>It can give information about the developers themselves, which
        is almost entirely lacking in the original source code.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    At present (20090703), this effort has barely begun.&nbsp; To get an
    idea of what some annotations might look like, you can look at the <a
href="listings/Luminary099/PINBALL_GAME_BUTTONS_AND_LIGHTS.agc.html">Apollo
11



















      LM PINBALL program</a>.<br>
    <br>
    In order to provide such annotations, it is necessary to understand
    the markup language and strategy being used, which is <a
      href="SourceAnnotations.html">described here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    There is presently not total agreement as to the best method of
    managing the annotation efforts.&nbsp; For now, if you wish to
    participate, I'd suggest that you decide which source file(s) you'd
    like to work on, chosen from among the programs Luminary 99,
    Comanche 55, or Flight Program 6.&nbsp; Then contact me so that I
    know you're working on it.&nbsp; Make changes directly in the source
    files and send them to me.<br>
