# The Virtual AGC Website

Whereas the main branch of the virtualagc repo is associated with the source code for the AGC
itself and support toolset (AGC assembler, simulator, and so on), the gh-pages branch of the virtualagc repo is associated with development of 
[the Virtual AGC website] (http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo).  The material in
the gh-pages branch is automatically turned into 
[a separate website] (https://virtualagc.github.io/virtualagc/index.html) as well,
which is used as a staging ground for testing the updates prior to pushing
them to the main website.  Hence the two websites are roughly identical in content,
except that the latter may be more up-to-date, but possible also buggier.
